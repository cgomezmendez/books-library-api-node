Athena API
==================

This is a test application written for GBH.

__Athena__ is an API for a book's library with the following features:

* Users can list available books
* Users are able to read each book page in the desired format
* Books are available in plain text and HTML

Note: in a future we want to add support to more reading formats and be able to connect with other API that provides books.
