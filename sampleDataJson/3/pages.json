His pale grey eyes shone and twinkled, and\r\nhis usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire burnt brightly,\r\nand the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver\r\ncaught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses. Our chairs,\r\nbeing his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat\r\nupon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere, when thought\r\nruns gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in\r\nthis way&mdash;marking the points with a lean forefinger&mdash;as we sat\r\nand lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it)\r\nand his fecundity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or\r\ntwo ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance,\r\nthey taught you at school is founded on a misconception.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin\r\nupon?&rdquo; said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable\r\nground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of\r\ncourse that a mathematical line, a line of thickness <i>nil</i>, has no\r\nreal existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane.\r\nThese things are mere abstractions.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;That is all right,&rdquo; said the Psychologist.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have\r\na real existence.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;There I object,&rdquo; said Filby. &ldquo;Of course a solid body\r\nmay exist. All real things&mdash;&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an\r\n<i>instantaneous</i> cube exist?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t follow you,&rdquo; said Filby.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real\r\nexistence?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFilby became pensive. &ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; the Time Traveller\r\nproceeded, &ldquo;any real body must have extension in <i>four</i>\r\ndirections: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and&mdash;Duration.\r\nBut through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you\r\nin a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four\r\ndimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth,\r\nTime. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between\r\nthe former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our\r\nconsciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from\r\nthe beginning to the end of our lives.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to\r\nrelight his cigar over the lamp; &ldquo;that . . . very clear\r\nindeed.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively\r\noverlooked,&rdquo; continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of\r\ncheerfulness. &ldquo;Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension,\r\nthough some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they\r\nmean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. <i>There is no\r\ndifference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except\r\nthat our consciousness moves along it</i>. But some foolish people have got\r\nhold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to\r\nsay about this Fourth Dimension?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;<i>I</i> have not,&rdquo; said the Provincial Mayor.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is\r\nspoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth,\r\nand Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three planes, each\r\nat right angles to the others. But some philosophical people have been\r\nasking why <i>three</i> dimensions particularly&mdash;why not another\r\ndirection at right angles to the other three?&mdash;and have even tried to\r\nconstruct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding\r\nthis to the New York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know\r\nhow on a flat surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a\r\nfigure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by\r\nmodels of three dimensions they could represent one of four&mdash;if they\r\ncould master the perspective of the thing. See?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting\r\nhis brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one\r\nwho repeats mystic words. &ldquo;Yes, I think I see it now,&rdquo; he said\r\nafter some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this\r\ngeometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious.\r\nFor instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at\r\nfifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All\r\nthese are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations\r\nof his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Scientific people,&rdquo; proceeded the Time Traveller, after the\r\npause required for the proper assimilation of this, &ldquo;know very well\r\nthat Time is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a\r\nweather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the\r\nbarometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this\r\nmorning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the mercury did\r\nnot trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognised?\r\nBut certainly it traced such a line, and that line, therefore, we must\r\nconclude, was along the Time-Dimension.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the\r\nfire, &ldquo;if Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it,\r\nand why has it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot\r\nwe move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of\r\nSpace?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Time Traveller smiled. &ldquo;Are you so sure we can move freely in\r\nSpace? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and\r\nmen always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions. But how\r\nabout up and down? Gravitation limits us there.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; said the Medical Man. &ldquo;There are\r\nballoons.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the\r\ninequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical\r\nmovement.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Still they could move a little up and down,&rdquo; said the\r\nMedical Man.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Easier, far easier down than up.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the\r\npresent moment.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where\r\nthe whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present\r\nmoment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions,\r\nare passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the\r\ncradle to the grave. Just as we should travel <i>down</i> if we began our\r\nexistence fifty miles above the earth&rsquo;s surface.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;But the great difficulty is this,&rdquo; interrupted the\r\nPsychologist. &rsquo;You <i>can</i> move about in all directions of Space,\r\nbut you cannot move about in Time.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say\r\nthat we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an\r\nincident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I become\r\nabsent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course we have no\r\nmeans of staying back for any length of Time, any more than a savage or an\r\nanimal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a civilised man is\r\nbetter off than the savage in this respect. He can go up against\r\ngravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that ultimately he may\r\nbe able to stop or accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even\r\nturn about and travel the other way?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Oh, <i>this</i>,&rdquo; began Filby, &ldquo;is\r\nall&mdash;&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said the Time Traveller.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s against reason,&rdquo; said Filby.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;What reason?&rdquo; said the Time Traveller.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;You can show black is white by argument,&rdquo; said Filby,\r\n&ldquo;but you will never convince me.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Possibly not,&rdquo; said the Time Traveller. &ldquo;But now you\r\nbegin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of Four\r\nDimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine&mdash;&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;To travel through Time!&rdquo; exclaimed the Very Young Man.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and\r\nTime, as the driver determines.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFilby contented himself with laughter.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;But I have experimental verification,&rdquo; said the Time\r\nTraveller.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,&rdquo; the\r\nPsychologist suggested. &ldquo;One might travel back and verify the\r\naccepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you would attract attention?&rdquo; said\r\nthe Medical Man. &ldquo;Our ancestors had no great tolerance for\r\nanachronisms.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;One might get one&rsquo;s Greek from the very lips of Homer and\r\nPlato,&rdquo; the Very Young Man thought.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;In which case they would certainly plough you for the\r\nLittle-go. The German scholars have improved Greek so much.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Then there is the future,&rdquo; said the Very Young Man.\r\n&ldquo;Just think! One might invest all one&rsquo;s money, leave it to\r\naccumulate at interest, and hurry on ahead!&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;To discover a society,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;erected on a\r\nstrictly communistic basis.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Of all the wild extravagant theories!&rdquo; began the\r\nPsychologist.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it\r\nuntil&mdash;&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Experimental verification!&rdquo; cried I. &ldquo;You are going\r\nto verify <i>that</i>?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The experiment!&rdquo; cried Filby, who was getting\r\nbrain-weary.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see your experiment anyhow,&rdquo; said the\r\nPsychologist, &ldquo;though it&rsquo;s all humbug, you know.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and\r\nwith his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of the\r\nroom, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his\r\nlaboratory.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Psychologist looked at us. &ldquo;I wonder what he&rsquo;s\r\ngot?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,&rdquo; said the Medical Man,\r\nand Filby tried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before\r\nhe had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby&rsquo;s\r\nanecdote collapsed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"chap02\"></a></p> <h3> II </h3>\r\n\r\n","text":"I\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThe Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was\r\nexpounding a recondite matter to us.

Long\r\nago I had a vague inkling of a machine—”\r\n\r\n“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Very Young Man.\r\n\r\n“That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as\r\nthe driver determines.”\r\n\r\nFilby contented himself with laughter.\r\n\r\n“But I have experimental verification,” said the Time Traveller.\r\n\r\n“It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,” the Psychologist\r\nsuggested. “One might travel back and verify the accepted account of\r\nthe Battle of Hastings, for instance!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think you would attract attention?” said the Medical Man.\r\n“Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.”\r\n\r\n“One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,” the\r\nVery Young Man thought.\r\n\r\n“In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The\r\nGerman scholars have improved Greek so much.”\r\n\r\n“Then there is the future,” said the Very Young Man. “Just think! One\r\nmight invest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and\r\nhurry on ahead!”\r\n\r\n“To discover a society,” said I, “erected on a strictly communistic\r\nbasis.”\r\n\r\n“Of all the wild extravagant theories!” began the Psychologist.\r\n\r\n“Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until—”\r\n\r\n“Experimental verification!” cried I. “You are going to verify _that_?”\r\n\r\n“The experiment!” cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.\r\n\r\n“Let’s see your experiment anyhow,” said the Psychologist, “though it’s\r\nall humbug, you know.”\r\n\r\nThe Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and\r\nwith his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of\r\nthe room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to\r\nhis laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe Psychologist looked at us. “I wonder what he’s got?”\r\n\r\n“Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,” said the Medical Man, and Filby\r\ntried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he\r\nhad finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s\r\nanecdote collapsed.","updatedAt":"2018-07-19T06:39:08.829Z","createdAt":"2018-07-19T06:39:08.829Z"},{"number":5,"bookId":3,"html":"<h2> The Machine </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic\r\nframework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made.\r\nThere was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline substance.

Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in the Time\r\nTraveller&rsquo;s words, we should have shown <i>him</i> far less\r\nscepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a pork-butcher could\r\nunderstand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more than a touch of whim\r\namong his elements, and we distrusted him. Things that would have made the\r\nfame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to\r\ndo things too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt\r\nquite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting their\r\nreputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with\r\neggshell china. So I don&rsquo;t think any of us said very much about time\r\ntravelling in the interval between that Thursday and the next, though its\r\nodd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of our minds: its plausibility,\r\nthat is, its practical incredibleness, the curious possibilities of\r\nanachronism and of utter confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was\r\nparticularly preoccupied with the trick of the model. That I remember\r\ndiscussing with the Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linnæan. He\r\nsaid he had seen a similar thing at Tübingen, and laid considerable stress\r\non the blowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not\r\nexplain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe next Thursday I went again to Richmond&mdash;I suppose I was one of\r\nthe Time Traveller&rsquo;s most constant guests&mdash;and, arriving late,\r\nfound four or five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical\r\nMan was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his\r\nwatch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller,\r\nand&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s half-past seven now,&rdquo; said the Medical\r\nMan. &ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;d better have dinner?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; said I, naming our host.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just come? It&rsquo;s rather odd. He&rsquo;s\r\nunavoidably detained. He asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at\r\nseven if he&rsquo;s not back. Says he&rsquo;ll explain when he\r\ncomes.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,&rdquo; said the Editor\r\nof a well-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself who\r\nhad attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Editor\r\naforementioned, a certain journalist, and another&mdash;a quiet, shy man\r\nwith a beard&mdash;whom I didn&rsquo;t know, and who, as far as my\r\nobservation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was some\r\nspeculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller&rsquo;s absence,\r\nand I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor\r\nwanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden\r\naccount of the &ldquo;ingenious paradox and trick&rdquo; we had witnessed\r\nthat day week. He was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the\r\ncorridor opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it\r\nfirst. &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; And the door\r\nopened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of\r\nsurprise. &ldquo;Good heavens! man, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; cried\r\nthe Medical Man, who saw him next. And the whole tableful turned towards\r\nthe door.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared\r\nwith green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to me\r\ngreyer&mdash;either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually\r\nfaded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it&mdash;a\r\ncut half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense\r\nsuffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been\r\ndazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just such\r\na limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in silence,\r\nexpecting him to speak.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion\r\ntowards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it\r\ntowards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked\r\nround the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his face.\r\n&ldquo;What on earth have you been up to, man?&rdquo; said the Doctor. The\r\nTime Traveller did not seem to hear. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me disturb\r\nyou,&rdquo; he said, with a certain faltering articulation.\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo; He stopped, held out his glass for more,\r\nand took it off at a draught. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; he said. His\r\neyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance\r\nflickered over our faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round\r\nthe warm and comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were\r\nfeeling his way among his words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to wash and dress,\r\nand then I&rsquo;ll come down and explain things.... Save me some of that\r\nmutton. I&rsquo;m starving for a bit of meat.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he was\r\nall right. The Editor began a question. &ldquo;Tell you presently,&rdquo;\r\nsaid the Time Traveller. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;funny! Be all right in a\r\nminute.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I\r\nremarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and\r\nstanding up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing on\r\nthem but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the door closed upon\r\nhim. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he detested any\r\nfuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was wool-gathering.\r\nThen, &ldquo;Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,&rdquo; I heard\r\nthe Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this brought my\r\nattention back to the bright dinner-table.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the game?&rdquo; said the Journalist. &ldquo;Has he\r\nbeen doing the Amateur Cadger? I don&rsquo;t follow.&rdquo; I met the eye\r\nof the Psychologist, and read my own interpretation in his face. I thought\r\nof the Time Traveller limping painfully upstairs. I don&rsquo;t think\r\nanyone else had noticed his lameness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man,\r\nwho rang the bell&mdash;the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting\r\nat dinner&mdash;for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his knife and\r\nfork with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The dinner was\r\nresumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of\r\nwonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity. &ldquo;Does\r\nour friend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he his\r\nNebuchadnezzar phases?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;I feel assured it&rsquo;s\r\nthis business of the Time Machine,&rdquo; I said, and took up the\r\nPsychologist&rsquo;s account of our previous meeting. The new guests were\r\nfrankly incredulous. The Editor raised objections. &ldquo;What <i>was</i>\r\nthis time travelling? A man couldn&rsquo;t cover himself with dust by\r\nrolling in a paradox, could he?&rdquo; And then, as the idea came home to\r\nhim, he resorted to caricature. Hadn&rsquo;t they any clothes-brushes in\r\nthe Future? The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, and joined\r\nthe Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They\r\nwere both the new kind of journalist&mdash;very joyous, irreverent young\r\nmen. &ldquo;Our Special Correspondent in the Day after Tomorrow\r\nreports,&rdquo; the Journalist was saying&mdash;or rather\r\nshouting&mdash;when the Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in\r\nordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained of the\r\nchange that had startled me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said the Editor hilariously, &ldquo;these chaps\r\nhere say you have been travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all\r\nabout little Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word. He\r\nsmiled quietly, in his old way. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my mutton?&rdquo; he\r\nsaid. &ldquo;What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Story!&rdquo; cried the Editor.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Story be damned!&rdquo; said the Time Traveller. &ldquo;I want\r\nsomething to eat. I won&rsquo;t say a word until I get some peptone into my\r\narteries. Thanks. And the salt.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;One word,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Have you been time\r\ntravelling?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding\r\nhis head.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,&rdquo; said\r\nthe Editor. The Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and\r\nrang it with his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring\r\nat his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the\r\ndinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising\r\nto my lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalist\r\ntried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The\r\nTime Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the\r\nappetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the\r\nTime Traveller through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more\r\nclumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination\r\nout of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate away,\r\nand looked round us. &ldquo;I suppose I must apologise,&rdquo; he said.\r\n&ldquo;I was simply starving. I&rsquo;ve had a most amazing time.&rdquo; He\r\nreached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. &ldquo;But come into the\r\nsmoking-room. It&rsquo;s too long a story to tell over greasy\r\nplates.&rdquo; And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the\r\nadjoining room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the\r\nmachine?&rdquo; he said to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming\r\nthe three new guests.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;But the thing&rsquo;s a mere paradox,&rdquo; said the Editor.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t argue tonight. I don&rsquo;t mind telling you the\r\nstory, but I can&rsquo;t argue. I will,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;tell you\r\nthe story of what has happened to me, if you like, but you must refrain\r\nfrom interruptions. I want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like\r\nlying. So be it! It&rsquo;s true&mdash;every word of it, all the same. I\r\nwas in my laboratory at four o&rsquo;clock, and since then … I&rsquo;ve\r\nlived eight days … such days as no human being ever lived before! I&rsquo;m\r\nnearly worn out, but I shan&rsquo;t sleep till I&rsquo;ve told this thing\r\nover to you. Then I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it\r\nagreed?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed\r\n&ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo; And with that the Time Traveller began his story as I\r\nhave set it forth. He sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a\r\nweary man. Afterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with\r\nonly too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink&mdash;and, above all,\r\nmy own inadequacy&mdash;to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,\r\nattentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker&rsquo;s white, sincere\r\nface in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the intonation of\r\nhis voice. You cannot know how his expression followed the turns of his\r\nstory! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in the\r\nsmoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face of the Journalist and\r\nthe legs of the Silent Man from the knees downward were illuminated. At\r\nfirst we glanced now and again at each other. After a time we ceased to do\r\nthat, and looked only at the Time Traveller&rsquo;s face.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"chap04\"></a></p> <h3> IV </h3>\r\n\r\n","text":"III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Time Traveller Returns\r\n\r\nI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time\r\nMachine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are\r\ntoo clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him;\r\nyou always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush,\r\nbehind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the\r\nmatter in the Time Traveller’s words, we should have shown _him_ far\r\nless scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a\r\npork-butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more\r\nthan a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things\r\nthat would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his\r\nhands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who\r\ntook him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were\r\nsomehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was\r\nlike furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don’t think any of\r\nus said very much about time travelling in the interval between that\r\nThursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in\r\nmost of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical\r\nincredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter\r\nconfusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied\r\nwith the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the\r\nMedical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linnæan. He said he had seen a\r\nsimilar thing at Tübingen, and laid considerable stress on the\r\nblowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\nThe next Thursday I went again to Richmond—I suppose I was one of the\r\nTime Traveller’s most constant guests—and, arriving late, found four or\r\nfive men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was\r\nstanding before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his\r\nwatch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller, and—“It’s\r\nhalf-past seven now,” said the Medical Man. “I suppose we’d better have\r\ndinner?”\r\n\r\n“Where’s——?” said I, naming our host.\r\n\r\n“You’ve just come? It’s rather odd. He’s unavoidably detained. He asks\r\nme in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he’s not back. Says\r\nhe’ll explain when he comes.”\r\n\r\n“It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,” said the Editor of a\r\nwell-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.\r\n\r\nThe Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself who\r\nhad attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Editor\r\naforementioned, a certain journalist, and another—a quiet, shy man with\r\na beard—whom I didn’t know, and who, as far as my observation went,\r\nnever opened his mouth all the evening. There was some speculation at\r\nthe dinner-table about the Time Traveller’s absence, and I suggested\r\ntime travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor wanted that\r\nexplained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of\r\nthe “ingenious paradox and trick” we had witnessed that day week. He\r\nwas in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor\r\nopened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it\r\nfirst. “Hallo!” I said. “At last!” And the door opened wider, and the\r\nTime Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. “Good\r\nheavens! man, what’s the matter?” cried the Medical Man, who saw him\r\nnext. And the whole tableful turned towards the door.\r\n\r\nHe was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared\r\nwith green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to\r\nme greyer—either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually\r\nfaded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it—a cut\r\nhalf-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense\r\nsuffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been\r\ndazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just\r\nsuch a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in\r\nsilence, expecting him to speak.\r\n\r\nHe said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion\r\ntowards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it\r\ntowards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked\r\nround the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his\r\nface. “What on earth have you been up to, man?” said the Doctor. The\r\nTime Traveller did not seem to hear. “Don’t let me disturb you,” he\r\nsaid, with a certain faltering articulation. “I’m all right.” He\r\nstopped, held out his glass for more, and took it off at a draught.\r\n“That’s good,” he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came\r\ninto his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain\r\ndull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then\r\nhe spoke again, still as it were feeling his way among his words. “I’m\r\ngoing to wash and dress, and then I’ll come down and explain things....\r\nSave me some of that mutton. I’m starving for a bit of meat.”\r\n\r\nHe looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he\r\nwas all right. The Editor began a question. “Tell you presently,” said\r\nthe Time Traveller. “I’m—funny! Be all right in a minute.”\r\n\r\nHe put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I\r\nremarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and\r\nstanding up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing\r\non them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the door\r\nclosed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he\r\ndetested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was\r\nwool-gathering. Then, “Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,” I\r\nheard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this\r\nbrought my attention back to the bright dinner-table.\r\n\r\n“What’s the game?” said the Journalist. “Has he been doing the Amateur\r\nCadger? I don’t follow.” I met the eye of the Psychologist, and read my\r\nown interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time Traveller limping\r\npainfully upstairs. I don’t think anyone else had noticed his lameness.\r\n\r\nThe first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man,\r\nwho rang the bell—the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting at\r\ndinner—for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his knife and fork\r\nwith a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit.

At last the Time Traveller\r\npushed his plate away, and looked round us. “I suppose I must\r\napologise,” he said. “I was simply starving. I’ve had a most amazing\r\ntime.” He reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. “But come\r\ninto the smoking-room. It’s too long a story to tell over greasy\r\nplates.” And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the\r\nadjoining room.\r\n\r\n“You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?” he said\r\nto me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests.\r\n\r\n“But the thing’s a mere paradox,” said the Editor.\r\n\r\n“I can’t argue tonight.

There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the\r\nivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it&rsquo;s\r\nsound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when the\r\nputting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel bars was\r\nexactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; so that the thing\r\nwas not complete until this morning. It was at ten o&rsquo;clock today\r\nthat the first of all Time Machines began its career. I gave it a last tap,\r\ntried all the screws again, put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and\r\nsat myself in the saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his\r\nskull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I\r\ntook the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other,\r\npressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to reel; I\r\nfelt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round, I saw the\r\nlaboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For a moment I\r\nsuspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted the clock. A\r\nmoment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute or so past ten; now\r\nit was nearly half-past three!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with\r\nboth hands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went\r\ndark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me,\r\ntowards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse\r\nthe place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I\r\npressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the\r\nturning out of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. The laboratory\r\ngrew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. Tomorrow night came\r\nblack, then day again, night again, day again, faster and faster still. An\r\neddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended\r\non my mind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time\r\ntravelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly\r\nlike that one has upon a switchback&mdash;of a helpless headlong motion! I\r\nfelt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I put on\r\npace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The dim\r\nsuggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me, and I\r\nsaw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every minute, and\r\nevery minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had been destroyed\r\nand I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression of scaffolding,\r\nbut I was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things. The\r\nslowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling\r\nsuccession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then,\r\nin the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her\r\nquarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars.\r\nPresently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night\r\nand day merged into one continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful\r\ndeepness of blue, a splendid luminous colour like that of early twilight;\r\nthe jerking sun became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the\r\nmoon a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save\r\nnow and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hillside\r\nupon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and\r\ndim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown, now\r\ngreen; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw huge buildings\r\nrise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The whole surface of the\r\nearth seemed changed&mdash;melting and flowing under my eyes. The little\r\nhands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and\r\nfaster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and down, from\r\nsolstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that consequently my pace\r\nwas over a year a minute; and minute by minute the white snow flashed\r\nacross the world, and vanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green\r\nof spring.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now.\r\nThey merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked,\r\nindeed, a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to account.\r\nBut my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind of madness\r\ngrowing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first I scarce thought of\r\nstopping, scarce thought of anything but these new sensations. But\r\npresently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind&mdash;a certain\r\ncuriosity and therewith a certain dread&mdash;until at last they took\r\ncomplete possession of me. What strange developments of humanity, what\r\nwonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation, I thought, might not\r\nappear when I came to look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and\r\nfluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising\r\nabout me, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it\r\nseemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the\r\nhillside, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even through\r\nthe veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. And so my mind came\r\nround to the business of stopping.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some\r\nsubstance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I\r\ntravelled at a high velocity through time, this scarcely mattered: I was,\r\nso to speak, attenuated&mdash;was slipping like a vapour through the\r\ninterstices of intervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the\r\njamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant\r\nbringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle\r\nthat a profound chemical reaction&mdash;possibly a far-reaching\r\nexplosion&mdash;would result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of all\r\npossible dimensions&mdash;into the Unknown. This possibility had occurred\r\nto me again and again while I was making the machine; but then I had\r\ncheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk&mdash;one of the risks a man\r\nhas got to take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the\r\nsame cheerful light. The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness\r\nof everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all,\r\nthe feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerves. I told\r\nmyself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I resolved to\r\nstop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over the lever, and\r\nincontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was flung headlong through\r\nthe air.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been\r\nstunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was\r\nsitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine. Everything still\r\nseemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was\r\ngone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a\r\ngarden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their mauve\r\nand purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the\r\nhailstones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a little cloud over the\r\nmachine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to\r\nthe skin. &lsquo;Fine hospitality,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;to a man who has\r\ntravelled innumerable years to see you.&rsquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and\r\nlooked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white stone,\r\nloomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy downpour. But\r\nall else of the world was invisible.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail\r\ngrew thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large,\r\nfor a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in\r\nshape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being\r\ncarried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to hover.\r\nThe pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick with\r\nverdigris. It chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless eyes\r\nseemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It\r\nwas greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of\r\ndisease. I stood looking at it for a little space&mdash;half a minute,\r\nperhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail\r\ndrove before it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a\r\nmoment, and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky\r\nwas lightening with the promise of the sun.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full\r\ntemerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when that\r\nhazy curtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have happened to men?\r\nWhat if cruelty had grown into a common passion? What if in this interval\r\nthe race had lost its manliness, and had developed into something inhuman,\r\nunsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I might seem some old-world\r\nsavage animal, only the more dreadful and disgusting for our common\r\nlikeness&mdash;a foul creature to be incontinently slain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Already I saw other vast shapes&mdash;huge buildings with\r\nintricate parapets and tall columns, with a wooded hillside dimly creeping\r\nin upon me through the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic fear. I\r\nturned frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to readjust it. As\r\nI did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm. The grey\r\ndownpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a\r\nghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faint brown\r\nshreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildings about me\r\nstood out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and\r\npicked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I\r\nfelt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in the\r\nclear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop. My fear grew to\r\nfrenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and again grappled\r\nfiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave under my desperate\r\nonset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. One hand on the saddle,\r\nthe other on the lever, I stood panting heavily in attitude to mount\r\nagain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered.\r\nI looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote\r\nfuture. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer house, I\r\nsaw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had seen me, and their\r\nfaces were directed towards me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by\r\nthe White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of these\r\nemerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which I stood\r\nwith my machine. He was a slight creature&mdash;perhaps four feet\r\nhigh&mdash;clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather\r\nbelt. Sandals or buskins&mdash;I could not clearly distinguish\r\nwhich&mdash;were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head\r\nwas bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warm the air\r\nwas.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but\r\nindescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful\r\nkind of consumptive&mdash;that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so\r\nmuch. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence. I took my hands\r\nfrom the machine.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"chap05\"></a></p> <h3> V </h3>\r\n\r\n","text":"IV\r\n\r\n\r\nTime Travelling\r\n\r\n“I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time\r\nMachine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the\r\nworkshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the\r\nivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it’s\r\nsound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when\r\nthe putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel\r\nbars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; so\r\nthat the thing was not complete until this morning. It was at ten\r\no’clock today that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I\r\ngave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of\r\noil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a\r\nsuicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at\r\nwhat will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever in one\r\nhand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost\r\nimmediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation\r\nof falling; and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before.\r\nHad anything happened? For a moment I suspected that my intellect had\r\ntricked me. Then I noted the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it\r\nhad stood at a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past\r\nthree!\r\n\r\n“I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both\r\nhands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark.\r\nMrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards\r\nthe garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the\r\nplace, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I\r\npressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the\r\nturning out of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. The\r\nlaboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. Tomorrow\r\nnight came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and\r\nfaster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb\r\nconfusedness descended on my mind.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time\r\ntravelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly\r\nlike that one has upon a switchback—of a helpless headlong motion! I\r\nfelt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I\r\nput on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The\r\ndim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me,\r\nand I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every\r\nminute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had\r\nbeen destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression\r\nof scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any\r\nmoving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast\r\nfor me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively\r\npainful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the\r\nmoon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a\r\nfaint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, still\r\ngaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one\r\ncontinuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a\r\nsplendid luminous colour like that of early twilight; the jerking sun\r\nbecame a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter\r\nfluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and\r\nthen a brighter circle flickering in the blue.\r\n\r\n“The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hillside upon\r\nwhich this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and\r\ndim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown,\r\nnow green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw huge\r\nbuildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The whole\r\nsurface of the earth seemed changed—melting and flowing under my eyes.\r\nThe little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round\r\nfaster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and\r\ndown, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that\r\nconsequently my pace was over a year a minute; and minute by minute the\r\nwhite snow flashed across the world, and vanished, and was followed by\r\nthe bright, brief green of spring.\r\n\r\n“The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They\r\nmerged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked,\r\nindeed, a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to\r\naccount. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind\r\nof madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first I\r\nscarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new\r\nsensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my\r\nmind—a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread—until at last\r\nthey took complete possession of me. What strange developments of\r\nhumanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation, I\r\nthought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dim\r\nelusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and\r\nsplendid architecture rising about me, more massive than any buildings\r\nof our own time, and yet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I\r\nsaw a richer green flow up the hillside, and remain there, without any\r\nwintry intermission. Even through the veil of my confusion the earth\r\nseemed very fair. And so my mind came round to the business of\r\nstopping.\r\n\r\n“The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance\r\nin the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelled\r\nat a high velocity through time, this scarcely mattered: I was, so to\r\nspeak, attenuated—was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of\r\nintervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of\r\nmyself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant\r\nbringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle\r\nthat a profound chemical reaction—possibly a far-reaching\r\nexplosion—would result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of all\r\npossible dimensions—into the Unknown. This possibility had occurred to\r\nme again and again while I was making the machine; but then I had\r\ncheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk—one of the risks a man\r\nhas got to take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the\r\nsame cheerful light. The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute\r\nstrangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the\r\nmachine, above all, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely\r\nupset my nerves. I told myself that I could never stop, and with a gust\r\nof petulance I resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I\r\nlugged over the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over,\r\nand I was flung headlong through the air.\r\n\r\n“There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been\r\nstunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was\r\nsitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine. Everything still\r\nseemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was\r\ngone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a\r\ngarden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their\r\nmauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating\r\nof the hailstones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a little cloud\r\nover the machine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a moment I\r\nwas wet to the skin. ‘Fine hospitality,’ said I, ‘to a man who has\r\ntravelled innumerable years to see you.’\r\n\r\n“Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and\r\nlooked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white\r\nstone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy\r\ndownpour. But all else of the world was invisible.\r\n\r\n“My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew\r\nthinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, for\r\na silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in\r\nshape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being\r\ncarried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to\r\nhover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick\r\nwith verdigris. It chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless\r\neyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the\r\nlips. It was greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasant\r\nsuggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for a little space—half a\r\nminute, perhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as\r\nthe hail drove before it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from\r\nit for a moment, and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and\r\nthat the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun.\r\n\r\n“I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerity\r\nof my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when that hazy\r\ncurtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have happened to men?\r\nWhat if cruelty had grown into a common passion? What if in this\r\ninterval the race had lost its manliness, and had developed into\r\nsomething inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I might\r\nseem some old-world savage animal, only the more dreadful and\r\ndisgusting for our common likeness—a foul creature to be incontinently\r\nslain.\r\n\r\n“Already I saw other vast shapes—huge buildings with intricate parapets\r\nand tall columns, with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon me\r\nthrough the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic fear. I turned\r\nfrantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to readjust it. As I\r\ndid so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm. The grey\r\ndownpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a\r\nghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faint\r\nbrown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildings\r\nabout me stood out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the\r\nthunderstorm, and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled\r\nalong their courses. I felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps\r\na bird may feel in the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will\r\nswoop. My fear grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth,\r\nand again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave\r\nunder my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently.\r\nOne hand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily\r\nin attitude to mount again.\r\n\r\n“But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I\r\nlooked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote\r\nfuture. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer house,\r\nI saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes.

He was a slight creature—perhaps four feet\r\nhigh—clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather belt.\r\nSandals or buskins—I could not clearly distinguish which—were on his\r\nfeet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head was bare. Noticing\r\nthat, I noticed for the first time how warm the air was.\r\n\r\n“He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but\r\nindescribably frail.

He came straight up to me and laughed into\r\nmy eyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at\r\nonce. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to\r\nthem in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps\r\neight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them\r\naddressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too\r\nharsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears,\r\nshook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my\r\nhand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders.\r\nThey wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in this at all\r\nalarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty little people that\r\ninspired confidence&mdash;a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease.\r\nAnd besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy myself flinging the\r\nwhole dozen of them about like ninepins. But I made a sudden motion to\r\nwarn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine.\r\nHappily then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had\r\nhitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed\r\nthe little levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my pocket.\r\nThen I turned again to see what I could do in the way of communication.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some\r\nfurther peculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their\r\nhair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek;\r\nthere was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears\r\nwere singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather thin\r\nlips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and mild;\r\nand&mdash;this may seem egotism on my part&mdash;I fancied even that there\r\nwas a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood\r\nround me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began\r\nthe conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then,\r\nhesitating for a moment how to express Time, I pointed to the sun. At once\r\na quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed my\r\ngesture, and then astonished me by imitating the sound of thunder.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture\r\nwas plain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were these\r\ncreatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me. You see, I had\r\nalways anticipated that the people of the year Eight Hundred and Two\r\nThousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, art,\r\neverything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed him\r\nto be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old\r\nchildren&mdash;asked me, in fact, if I had come from the sun in a\r\nthunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended upon their clothes,\r\ntheir frail light limbs, and fragile features. A flow of disappointment\r\nrushed across my mind. For a moment I felt that I had built the Time\r\nMachine in vain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid\r\nrendering of a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so\r\nand bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful\r\nflowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck. The idea was\r\nreceived with melodious applause; and presently they were all running to\r\nand fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging them upon me until I was\r\nalmost smothered with blossom. You who have never seen the like can\r\nscarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of\r\nculture had created. Then someone suggested that their plaything should be\r\nexhibited in the nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of\r\nwhite marble, which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my\r\nastonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. As I went with\r\nthem the memory of my confident anticipations of a profoundly grave and\r\nintellectual posterity came, with irresistible merriment, to my mind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal\r\ndimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of little\r\npeople, and with the big open portals that yawned before me shadowy and\r\nmysterious. My general impression of the world I saw over their heads was a\r\ntangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a long neglected and yet\r\nweedless garden. I saw a number of tall spikes of strange white flowers,\r\nmeasuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals. They grew\r\nscattered, as if wild, among the variegated shrubs, but, as I say, I did\r\nnot examine them closely at this time. The Time Machine was left deserted\r\non the turf among the rhododendrons.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did\r\nnot observe the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions\r\nof old Phœnician decorations as I passed through, and it struck me that\r\nthey were very badly broken and weather-worn. Several more brightly clad\r\npeople met me in the doorway, and so we entered, I, dressed in dingy\r\nnineteenth-century garments, looking grotesque enough, garlanded with\r\nflowers, and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright, soft-coloured robes\r\nand shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing\r\nspeech.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung\r\nwith brown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with\r\ncoloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The floor\r\nwas made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal, not plates nor\r\nslabs&mdash;blocks, and it was so much worn, as I judged by the going to\r\nand fro of past generations, as to be deeply channelled along the more\r\nfrequented ways. Transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of\r\nslabs of polished stone, raised, perhaps, a foot from the floor, and upon\r\nthese were heaps of fruits. Some I recognised as a kind of hypertrophied\r\nraspberry and orange, but for the most part they were strange.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. Upon\r\nthese my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do likewise. With\r\na pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with their hands,\r\nflinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into the round openings in the\r\nsides of the tables. I was not loath to follow their example, for I felt\r\nthirsty and hungry. As I did so I surveyed the hall at my leisure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated\r\nlook. The stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical\r\npattern, were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung across the\r\nlower end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that the corner of the\r\nmarble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless, the general effect was\r\nextremely rich and picturesque. There were, perhaps, a couple of hundred\r\npeople dining in the hall, and most of them, seated as near to me as they\r\ncould come, were watching me with interest, their little eyes shining over\r\nthe fruit they were eating. All were clad in the same soft, and yet strong,\r\nsilky material.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Fruit, by the bye, was all their diet. These people of the remote\r\nfuture were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite of some\r\ncarnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I found afterwards\r\nthat horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the Ichthyosaurus into\r\nextinction. But the fruits were very delightful; one, in particular, that\r\nseemed to be in season all the time I was there&mdash;a floury thing in a\r\nthree-sided husk&mdash;was especially good, and I made it my staple. At\r\nfirst I was puzzled by all these strange fruits, and by the strange flowers\r\nI saw, but later I began to perceive their import.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future\r\nnow. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to make a\r\nresolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine. Clearly that\r\nwas the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a convenient thing to begin\r\nupon, and holding one of these up I began a series of interrogative sounds\r\nand gestures. I had some considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning.\r\nAt first my efforts met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable\r\nlaughter, but presently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my\r\nintention and repeated a name. They had to chatter and explain the business\r\nat great length to each other, and my first attempts to make the exquisite\r\nlittle sounds of their language caused an immense amount of genuine, if\r\nuncivil, amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children,\r\nand persisted, and presently I had a score of noun substantives at least at\r\nmy command; and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and even the verb\r\n&lsquo;to eat.&rsquo; But it was slow work, and the little people soon\r\ntired and wanted to get away from my interrogations, so I determined,\r\nrather of necessity, to let them give their lessons in little doses when\r\nthey felt inclined. And very little doses I found they were before long,\r\nfor I never met people more indolent or more easily fatigued.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"chap06\"></a></p> <h3> VI </h3>\r\n\r\n","text":"V\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Golden Age\r\n\r\n“In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile\r\nthing out of futurity.

Their hair,\r\nwhich was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek;\r\nthere was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears\r\nwere singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather\r\nthin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and\r\nmild; and—this may seem egotism on my part—I fancied even that there\r\nwas a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them.\r\n\r\n“As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round\r\nme smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the\r\nconversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then,\r\nhesitating for a moment how to express Time, I pointed to the sun. At\r\nonce a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white\r\nfollowed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the sound of\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\n“For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was\r\nplain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were these\r\ncreatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me. You see, I\r\nhad always anticipated that the people of the year Eight Hundred and\r\nTwo Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, art,\r\neverything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed\r\nhim to be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old\r\nchildren—asked me, in fact, if I had come from the sun in a\r\nthunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended upon their\r\nclothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features. A flow of\r\ndisappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt that I had\r\nbuilt the Time Machine in vain.\r\n\r\n“I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering of\r\na thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so and\r\nbowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful\r\nflowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck. The idea was\r\nreceived with melodious applause; and presently they were all running\r\nto and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging them upon me until I\r\nwas almost smothered with blossom. You who have never seen the like can\r\nscarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of\r\nculture had created. Then someone suggested that their plaything should\r\nbe exhibited in the nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx\r\nof white marble, which had seemed to watch me all the while with a\r\nsmile at my astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone.\r\nAs I went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a\r\nprofoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible\r\nmerriment, to my mind.\r\n\r\n“The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal\r\ndimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of\r\nlittle people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me\r\nshadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw over\r\ntheir heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a long\r\nneglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number of tall spikes of\r\nstrange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of\r\nthe waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if wild, among the variegated\r\nshrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine them closely at this time. The\r\nTime Machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons.\r\n\r\n“The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not\r\nobserve the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions\r\nof old Phœnician decorations as I passed through, and it struck me that\r\nthey were very badly broken and weather-worn. Several more brightly\r\nclad people met me in the doorway, and so we entered, I, dressed in\r\ndingy nineteenth-century garments, looking grotesque enough, garlanded\r\nwith flowers, and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright,\r\nsoft-coloured robes and shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl of\r\nlaughter and laughing speech.\r\n\r\n“The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with\r\nbrown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with\r\ncoloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The\r\nfloor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal, not\r\nplates nor slabs—blocks, and it was so much worn, as I judged by the\r\ngoing to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply channelled along\r\nthe more frequented ways. Transverse to the length were innumerable\r\ntables made of slabs of polished stone, raised, perhaps, a foot from\r\nthe floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits. Some I recognised as a\r\nkind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange, but for the most part they\r\nwere strange.\r\n\r\n“Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. Upon\r\nthese my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do likewise.\r\nWith a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with\r\ntheir hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into the round\r\nopenings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to follow their\r\nexample, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I surveyed the hall\r\nat my leisure.\r\n\r\n“And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look.\r\nThe stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical pattern,\r\nwere broken in many places, and the curtains that hung across the lower\r\nend were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that the corner of the\r\nmarble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless, the general effect\r\nwas extremely rich and picturesque. There were, perhaps, a couple of\r\nhundred people dining in the hall, and most of them, seated as near to\r\nme as they could come, were watching me with interest, their little\r\neyes shining over the fruit they were eating. All were clad in the same\r\nsoft, and yet strong, silky material.\r\n\r\n“Fruit, by the bye, was all their diet. These people of the remote\r\nfuture were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite of\r\nsome carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I found\r\nafterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the\r\nIchthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful;\r\none, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was\r\nthere—a floury thing in a three-sided husk—was especially good, and I\r\nmade it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange fruits,\r\nand by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to perceive their\r\nimport.\r\n\r\n“However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future\r\nnow. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to make\r\na resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine.\r\nClearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a convenient\r\nthing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began a series of\r\ninterrogative sounds and gestures. I had some considerable difficulty\r\nin conveying my meaning. At first my efforts met with a stare of\r\nsurprise or inextinguishable laughter, but presently a fair-haired\r\nlittle creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name. They\r\nhad to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other,\r\nand my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their\r\nlanguage caused an immense amount of genuine, if uncivil, amusement.\r\nHowever, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children, and persisted, and\r\npresently I had a score of noun substantives at least at my command;\r\nand then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and even the verb ‘to eat.’\r\nBut it was slow work, and the little people soon tired and wanted to\r\nget away from my interrogations, so I determined, rather of necessity,\r\nto let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined.\r\nAnd very little doses I found they were before long, for I never met\r\npeople more indolent or more easily fatigued.","updatedAt":"2018-07-19T06:39:08.829Z","createdAt":"2018-07-19T06:39:08.829Z"},{"number":9,"bookId":3,"html":"<h2> The Sunset of Mankind </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that\r\nwas their lack of interest.

The dinner and my\r\nconversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that almost all\r\nthose who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is odd, too, how\r\nspeedily I came to disregard these little people. I went out through the\r\nportal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was satisfied. I\r\nwas continually meeting more of these men of the future, who would follow\r\nme a little distance, chatter and laugh about me, and, having smiled and\r\ngesticulated in a friendly way, leave me again to my own devices.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the\r\ngreat hall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun. At\r\nfirst things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely different from\r\nthe world I had known&mdash;even the flowers. The big building I had left\r\nwas situated on the slope of a broad river valley, but the Thames had\r\nshifted, perhaps, a mile from its present position. I resolved to mount to\r\nthe summit of a crest, perhaps a mile and a half away, from which I could\r\nget a wider view of this our planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two\r\nThousand Seven Hundred and One, A.D. For that, I should explain, was the\r\ndate the little dials of my machine recorded.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;As I walked I was watching for every impression that could\r\npossibly help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I\r\nfound the world&mdash;for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for\r\ninstance, was a great heap of granite, bound together by masses of\r\naluminium, a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps, amidst\r\nwhich were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like plants&mdash;nettles\r\npossibly&mdash;but wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves, and\r\nincapable of stinging. It was evidently the derelict remains of some vast\r\nstructure, to what end built I could not determine. It was here that I was\r\ndestined, at a later date, to have a very strange experience&mdash;the\r\nfirst intimation of a still stranger discovery&mdash;but of that I will\r\nspeak in its proper place.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Looking round, with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I\r\nrested for a while, I realised that there were no small houses to be seen.\r\nApparently the single house, and possibly even the household, had vanished.\r\nHere and there among the greenery were palace-like buildings, but the house\r\nand the cottage, which form such characteristic features of our own English\r\nlandscape, had disappeared.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;&lsquo;Communism,&rsquo; said I to myself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the\r\nhalf-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash, I\r\nperceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft hairless\r\nvisage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem strange,\r\nperhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything was so strange.\r\nNow, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and in all the differences\r\nof texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each other, these\r\npeople of the future were alike. And the children seemed to my eyes to be\r\nbut the miniatures of their parents. I judged then that the children of\r\nthat time were extremely precocious, physically at least, and I found\r\nafterwards abundant verification of my opinion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I\r\nfelt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would\r\nexpect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman, the\r\ninstitution of the family, and the differentiation of occupations are mere\r\nmilitant necessities of an age of physical force. Where population is\r\nbalanced and abundant, much childbearing becomes an evil rather than a\r\nblessing to the State; where violence comes but rarely and offspring are\r\nsecure, there is less necessity&mdash;indeed there is no\r\nnecessity&mdash;for an efficient family, and the specialisation of the\r\nsexes with reference to their children&rsquo;s needs disappears. We see\r\nsome beginnings of this even in our own time, and in this future age it was\r\ncomplete. This, I must remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I\r\nwas to appreciate how far it fell short of the reality.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted\r\nby a pretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in a\r\ntransitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then resumed the\r\nthread of my speculations. There were no large buildings towards the top of\r\nthe hill, and as my walking powers were evidently miraculous, I was\r\npresently left alone for the first time. With a strange sense of freedom\r\nand adventure I pushed on up to the crest.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not\r\nrecognise, corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half\r\nsmothered in soft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance\r\nof griffins&rsquo; heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view\r\nof our old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and\r\nfair a view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the horizon\r\nand the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal bars of purple\r\nand crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in which the river lay\r\nlike a band of burnished steel. I have already spoken of the great palaces\r\ndotted about among the variegated greenery, some in ruins and some still\r\noccupied. Here and there rose a white or silvery figure in the waste garden\r\nof the earth, here and there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or\r\nobelisk. There were no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences\r\nof agriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I\r\nhad seen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation was\r\nsomething in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a\r\nhalf truth&mdash;or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane.\r\nThe ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the first\r\ntime I began to realise an odd consequence of the social effort in which we\r\nare at present engaged. And yet, come to think, it is a logical consequence\r\nenough. Strength is the outcome of need; security sets a premium on\r\nfeebleness. The work of ameliorating the conditions of life&mdash;the true\r\ncivilising process that makes life more and more secure&mdash;had gone\r\nsteadily on to a climax. One triumph of a united humanity over Nature had\r\nfollowed another. Things that are now mere dreams had become projects\r\ndeliberately put in hand and carried forward. And the harvest was what I\r\nsaw!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still\r\nin the rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but a little\r\ndepartment of the field of human disease, but, even so, it spreads its\r\noperations very steadily and persistently. Our agriculture and horticulture\r\ndestroy a weed just here and there and cultivate perhaps a score or so of\r\nwholesome plants, leaving the greater number to fight out a balance as they\r\ncan. We improve our favourite plants and animals&mdash;and how few they\r\nare&mdash;gradually by selective breeding; now a new and better peach, now\r\na seedless grape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient\r\nbreed of cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideals are vague\r\nand tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is\r\nshy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all this will be better\r\norganised, and still better. That is the drift of the current in spite of\r\nthe eddies. The whole world will be intelligent, educated, and\r\nco-operating; things will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of\r\nNature. In the end, wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of\r\nanimal and vegetable life to suit our human needs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done\r\nindeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine had\r\nleapt. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or fungi;\r\neverywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers; brilliant\r\nbutterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of preventive medicine was\r\nattained. Diseases had been stamped out. I saw no evidence of any\r\ncontagious diseases during all my stay. And I shall have to tell you later\r\nthat even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been profoundly\r\naffected by these changes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in\r\nsplendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them engaged\r\nin no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social nor economical\r\nstruggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all that commerce which\r\nconstitutes the body of our world, was gone. It was natural on that golden\r\nevening that I should jump at the idea of a social paradise. The difficulty\r\nof increasing population had been met, I guessed, and population had ceased\r\nto increase.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to\r\nthe change. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is the\r\ncause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom: conditions\r\nunder which the active, strong, and subtle survive and the weaker go to the\r\nwall; conditions that put a premium upon the loyal alliance of capable men,\r\nupon self-restraint, patience, and decision. And the institution of the\r\nfamily, and the emotions that arise therein, the fierce jealousy, the\r\ntenderness for offspring, parental self-devotion, all found their\r\njustification and support in the imminent dangers of the young. <i>Now</i>,\r\nwhere are these imminent dangers? There is a sentiment arising, and it will\r\ngrow, against connubial jealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion\r\nof all sorts; unnecessary things now, and things that make us\r\nuncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant\r\nlife.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of\r\nintelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my belief\r\nin a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes Quiet. Humanity\r\nhad been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had used all its abundant\r\nvitality to alter the conditions under which it lived. And now came the\r\nreaction of the altered conditions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that\r\nrestless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness. Even in\r\nour own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary to survival,\r\nare a constant source of failure. Physical courage and the love of battle,\r\nfor instance, are no great help&mdash;may even be hindrances&mdash;to a\r\ncivilised man. And in a state of physical balance and security, power,\r\nintellectual as well as physical, would be out of place. For countless\r\nyears I judged there had been no danger of war or solitary violence, no\r\ndanger from wild beasts, no wasting disease to require strength of\r\nconstitution, no need of toil. For such a life, what we should call the\r\nweak are as well equipped as the strong, are indeed no longer weak. Better\r\nequipped indeed they are, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for\r\nwhich there was no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I\r\nsaw was the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy of\r\nmankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the conditions\r\nunder which it lived&mdash;the flourish of that triumph which began the\r\nlast great peace. This has ever been the fate of energy in security; it\r\ntakes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor and decay.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Even this artistic impetus would at last die away&mdash;had\r\nalmost died in the Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance,\r\nto sing in the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and no\r\nmore. Even that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity. We are\r\nkept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity, and it seemed to me\r\nthat here was that hateful grindstone broken at last!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this\r\nsimple explanation I had mastered the problem of the world&mdash;mastered\r\nthe whole secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they had\r\ndevised for the increase of population had succeeded too well, and their\r\nnumbers had rather diminished than kept stationary. That would account for\r\nthe abandoned ruins. Very simple was my explanation, and plausible\r\nenough&mdash;as most wrong theories are!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"chap07\"></a></p> <h3> VII </h3>\r\n\r\n","text":"VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sunset of Mankind\r\n\r\n“A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was\r\ntheir lack of interest.

One triumph of a united\r\nhumanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are now mere\r\ndreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried\r\nforward. And the harvest was what I saw!\r\n\r\n“After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still in\r\nthe rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but a\r\nlittle department of the field of human disease, but, even so, it\r\nspreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our agriculture\r\nand horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate\r\nperhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number\r\nto fight out a balance as they can. We improve our favourite plants and\r\nanimals—and how few they are—gradually by selective breeding; now a new\r\nand better peach, now a seedless grape, now a sweeter and larger\r\nflower, now a more convenient breed of cattle. We improve them\r\ngradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and our\r\nknowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and slow in our\r\nclumsy hands. Some day all this will be better organised, and still\r\nbetter. That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. The\r\nwhole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things\r\nwill move faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature. In the\r\nend, wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and\r\nvegetable life to suit our human needs.\r\n\r\n“This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done\r\nindeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine had\r\nleapt. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or fungi;\r\neverywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers; brilliant\r\nbutterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of preventive medicine\r\nwas attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I saw no evidence of any\r\ncontagious diseases during all my stay. And I shall have to tell you\r\nlater that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been\r\nprofoundly affected by these changes.\r\n\r\n“Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in\r\nsplendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them\r\nengaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social nor\r\neconomical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all that\r\ncommerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It was\r\nnatural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of a\r\nsocial paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been met,\r\nI guessed, and population had ceased to increase.\r\n\r\n“But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the\r\nchange. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is the\r\ncause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom:\r\nconditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and the\r\nweaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the loyal\r\nalliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and decision.\r\nAnd the institution of the family, and the emotions that arise therein,\r\nthe fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring, parental\r\nself-devotion, all found their justification and support in the\r\nimminent dangers of the young. _Now_, where are these imminent dangers?\r\nThere is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against connubial\r\njealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion of all sorts;\r\nunnecessary things now, and things that make us uncomfortable, savage\r\nsurvivals, discords in a refined and pleasant life.\r\n\r\n“I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of\r\nintelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my\r\nbelief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes\r\nQuiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had\r\nused all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it\r\nlived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.\r\n\r\n“Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that\r\nrestless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness. Even\r\nin our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary to\r\nsurvival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and the\r\nlove of battle, for instance, are no great help—may even be\r\nhindrances—to a civilised man. And in a state of physical balance and\r\nsecurity, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out of\r\nplace. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of war or\r\nsolitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting disease to\r\nrequire strength of constitution, no need of toil. For such a life,\r\nwhat we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong, are\r\nindeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they are, for the strong\r\nwould be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet. No doubt\r\nthe exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw was the outcome of the last\r\nsurgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settled\r\ndown into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived—the\r\nflourish of that triumph which began the last great peace. This has\r\never been the fate of energy in security; it takes to art and to\r\neroticism, and then come languor and decay.\r\n\r\n“Even this artistic impetus would at last die away—had almost died in\r\nthe Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing in\r\nthe sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and no more.\r\nEven that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity. We are\r\nkept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity, and it seemed to me\r\nthat here was that hateful grindstone broken at last!\r\n\r\n“As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this simple\r\nexplanation I had mastered the problem of the world—mastered the whole\r\nsecret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they had devised\r\nfor the increase of population had succeeded too well, and their\r\nnumbers had rather diminished than kept stationary. That would account\r\nfor the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my explanation, and plausible\r\nenough—as most wrong theories are!","updatedAt":"2018-07-19T06:39:08.829Z","createdAt":"2018-07-19T06:39:08.829Z"},{"number":10,"bookId":3,"html":"<h2> A Sudden Shock </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the\r\nfull moon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver light\r\nin the north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move about below, a\r\nnoiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the chill of the night. I\r\ndetermined to descend and find where I could sleep.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to\r\nthe figure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing\r\ndistinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see the\r\nsilver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron bushes, black\r\nin the pale light, and there was the little lawn. I looked at the lawn\r\nagain. A queer doubt chilled my complacency. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I stoutly to\r\nmyself, &lsquo;that was not the lawn.&rsquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;But it <i>was</i> the lawn. For the white leprous face of the\r\nsphinx was towards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came\r\nhome to me? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of\r\nlosing my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world. The\r\nbare thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could feel it grip\r\nme at the throat and stop my breathing. In another moment I was in a\r\npassion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope. Once\r\nI fell headlong and cut my face; I lost no time in stanching the blood, but\r\njumped up and ran on, with a warm trickle down my cheek and chin. All the\r\ntime I ran I was saying to myself: &lsquo;They have moved it a little, pushed it\r\nunder the bushes out of the way.&rsquo; Nevertheless, I ran with all my might.\r\nAll the time, with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread,\r\nI knew that such assurance was folly, knew instinctively that the machine\r\nwas removed out of my reach. My breath came with pain. I suppose I covered\r\nthe whole distance from the hill crest to the little lawn, two miles\r\nperhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young man. I cursed aloud, as I\r\nran, at my confident folly in leaving the machine, wasting good breath\r\nthereby. I cried aloud, and none answered. Not a creature seemed to be\r\nstirring in that moonlit world.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realised. Not a trace\r\nof the thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the empty\r\nspace among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it furiously, as if the\r\nthing might be hidden in a corner, and then stopped abruptly, with my hands\r\nclutching my hair. Above me towered the sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal,\r\nwhite, shining, leprous, in the light of the rising moon. It seemed to\r\nsmile in mockery of my dismay.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had\r\nput the mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of their\r\nphysical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed me: the sense\r\nof some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose intervention my invention\r\nhad vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt assured: unless some other age had\r\nproduced its exact duplicate, the machine could not have moved in time. The\r\nattachment of the levers&mdash;I will show you the method\r\nlater&mdash;prevented anyone from tampering with it in that way when they\r\nwere removed. It had moved, and was hid, only in space. But then, where\r\ncould it be?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running\r\nviolently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx, and\r\nstartling some white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a small\r\ndeer. I remember, too, late that night, beating the bushes with my clenched\r\nfist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs.\r\nThen, sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind, I went down to the great\r\nbuilding of stone. The big hall was dark, silent, and deserted. I slipped\r\non the uneven floor, and fell over one of the malachite tables, almost\r\nbreaking my shin. I lit a match and went on past the dusty curtains, of\r\nwhich I have told you.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon\r\nwhich, perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I have no\r\ndoubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming suddenly out\r\nof the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter and flare\r\nof a match. For they had forgotten about matches. &lsquo;Where is my Time\r\nMachine?&rsquo; I began, bawling like an angry child, laying hands upon them and\r\nshaking them up together. It must have been very queer to them. Some\r\nlaughed, most of them looked sorely frightened. When I saw them standing\r\nround me, it came into my head that I was doing as foolish a thing as it\r\nwas possible for me to do under the circumstances, in trying to revive the\r\nsensation of fear. For, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought\r\nthat fear must be forgotten.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and knocking one of the people\r\nover in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again, out\r\nunder the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little feet running\r\nand stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all I did as the moon\r\ncrept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected nature of my loss that\r\nmaddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind&mdash;a strange\r\nanimal in an unknown world. I must have raved to and fro, screaming and\r\ncrying upon God and Fate. I have a memory of horrible fatigue, as the long\r\nnight of despair wore away; of looking in this impossible place and that;\r\nof groping among moonlit ruins and touching strange creatures in the black\r\nshadows; at last, of lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with\r\nabsolute wretchedness, even anger at the folly of leaving the machine\r\nhaving leaked away with my strength. I had nothing left but misery. Then I\r\nslept, and when I woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were\r\nhopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I\r\nhad got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion and\r\ndespair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain, reasonable\r\ndaylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the face. I saw the wild\r\nfolly of my frenzy overnight, and I could reason with myself.\r\n&lsquo;Suppose the worst?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Suppose the machine\r\naltogether lost&mdash;perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be calm and\r\npatient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear idea of the method\r\nof my loss, and the means of getting materials and tools; so that in the\r\nend, perhaps, I may make another.&rsquo; That would be my only hope, a poor\r\nhope, perhaps, but better than despair. And, after all, it was a beautiful\r\nand curious world.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;But probably the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must\r\nbe calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force or\r\ncunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about me,\r\nwondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and travel-soiled. The\r\nfreshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness. I had exhausted\r\nmy emotion. Indeed, as I went about my business, I found myself wondering\r\nat my intense excitement overnight. I made a careful examination of the\r\nground about the little lawn. I wasted some time in futile questionings,\r\nconveyed, as well as I was able, to such of the little people as came by.\r\nThey all failed to understand my gestures; some were simply stolid, some\r\nthought it was a jest and laughed at me. I had the hardest task in the\r\nworld to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces. It was a foolish\r\nimpulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger was ill curbed and\r\nstill eager to take advantage of my perplexity. The turf gave better\r\ncounsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about midway between the pedestal\r\nof the sphinx and the marks of my feet where, on arrival, I had struggled\r\nwith the overturned machine. There were other signs of removal about, with\r\nqueer narrow footprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This\r\ndirected my closer attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have\r\nsaid, of bronze. It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep\r\nframed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. The pedestal was\r\nhollow. Examining the panels with care I found them discontinuous with the\r\nframes. There were no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, if they\r\nwere doors, as I supposed, opened from within. One thing was clear enough\r\nto my mind. It took no very great mental effort to infer that my Time\r\nMachine was inside that pedestal. But how it got there was a different\r\nproblem.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the\r\nbushes and under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned\r\nsmiling to them, and beckoned them to me. They came, and then, pointing to\r\nthe bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open it. But at my\r\nfirst gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I don&rsquo;t know how\r\nto convey their expression to you. Suppose you were to use a grossly\r\nimproper gesture to a delicate-minded woman&mdash;it is how she would look.\r\nThey went off as if they had received the last possible insult. I tried a\r\nsweet-looking little chap in white next, with exactly the same result.\r\nSomehow, his manner made me feel ashamed of myself. But, as you know, I\r\nwanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once more. As he turned off, like\r\nthe others, my temper got the better of me. In three strides I was after\r\nhim, had him by the loose part of his robe round the neck, and began\r\ndragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of\r\nhis face, and all of a sudden I let him go.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze\r\npanels. I thought I heard something stir inside&mdash;to be explicit, I\r\nthought I heard a sound like a chuckle&mdash;but I must have been mistaken.\r\nThen I got a big pebble from the river, and came and hammered till I had\r\nflattened a coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off in powdery\r\nflakes. The delicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty\r\noutbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd\r\nof them upon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I\r\nsat down to watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too\r\nOccidental for a long vigil. I could work at a problem for years, but to\r\nwait inactive for twenty-four hours&mdash;that is another matter.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the\r\nbushes towards the hill again. &lsquo;Patience,&rsquo; said I to myself.\r\n&lsquo;If you want your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If\r\nthey mean to take your machine away, it&rsquo;s little good your wrecking\r\ntheir bronze panels, and if they don&rsquo;t, you will get it back as soon\r\nas you can ask for it. To sit among all those unknown things before a\r\npuzzle like that is hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this world.\r\nLearn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning.\r\nIn the end you will find clues to it all.&rsquo; Then suddenly the humour\r\nof the situation came into my mind: the thought of the years I had spent in\r\nstudy and toil to get into the future age, and now my passion of anxiety to\r\nget out of it. I had made myself the most complicated and the most hopeless\r\ntrap that ever a man devised. Although it was at my own expense, I could\r\nnot help myself. I laughed aloud.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little\r\npeople avoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had something\r\nto do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt tolerably sure\r\nof the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no concern and to abstain\r\nfrom any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day or two things got back\r\nto the old footing. I made what progress I could in the language, and in\r\naddition I pushed my explorations here and there. Either I missed some\r\nsubtle point or their language was excessively simple&mdash;almost\r\nexclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be\r\nfew, if any, abstract terms, or little use of figurative language. Their\r\nsentences were usually simple and of two words, and I failed to convey or\r\nunderstand any but the simplest propositions. I determined to put the\r\nthought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronze doors under the\r\nsphinx, as much as possible in a corner of memory, until my growing\r\nknowledge would lead me back to them in a natural way. Yet a certain\r\nfeeling, you may understand, tethered me in a circle of a few miles round\r\nthe point of my arrival.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"chap08\"></a></p> <h3> VIII </h3>\r\n\r\n","text":"VII\r\n\r\n\r\nA Sudden Shock\r\n\r\n“As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the full\r\nmoon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver light in\r\nthe north-east.

This directed my closer\r\nattention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said, of bronze.\r\nIt was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep framed panels\r\non either side. I went and rapped at these. The pedestal was hollow.\r\nExamining the panels with care I found them discontinuous with the\r\nframes. There were no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, if\r\nthey were doors, as I supposed, opened from within. One thing was clear\r\nenough to my mind. It took no very great mental effort to infer that my\r\nTime Machine was inside that pedestal. But how it got there was a\r\ndifferent problem.\r\n\r\n“I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes\r\nand under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned smiling\r\nto them, and beckoned them to me. They came, and then, pointing to the\r\nbronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open it. But at my\r\nfirst gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I don’t know how to\r\nconvey their expression to you. Suppose you were to use a grossly\r\nimproper gesture to a delicate-minded woman—it is how she would look.\r\nThey went off as if they had received the last possible insult. I tried\r\na sweet-looking little chap in white next, with exactly the same\r\nresult. Somehow, his manner made me feel ashamed of myself. But, as you\r\nknow, I wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once more. As he\r\nturned off, like the others, my temper got the better of me. In three\r\nstrides I was after him, had him by the loose part of his robe round\r\nthe neck, and began dragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw the\r\nhorror and repugnance of his face, and all of a sudden I let him go.\r\n\r\n“But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze panels.\r\nI thought I heard something stir inside—to be explicit, I thought I\r\nheard a sound like a chuckle—but I must have been mistaken. Then I got\r\na big pebble from the river, and came and hammered till I had flattened\r\na coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off in powdery\r\nflakes. The delicate little people must have heard me hammering in\r\ngusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it. I\r\nsaw a crowd of them upon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last,\r\nhot and tired, I sat down to watch the place. But I was too restless to\r\nwatch long; I am too Occidental for a long vigil. I could work at a\r\nproblem for years, but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours—that is\r\nanother matter.\r\n\r\n“I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the bushes\r\ntowards the hill again. ‘Patience,’ said I to myself. ‘If you want your\r\nmachine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they mean to take\r\nyour machine away, it’s little good your wrecking their bronze panels,\r\nand if they don’t, you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it.\r\nTo sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is\r\nhopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this world. Learn its ways,\r\nwatch it, be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning. In the end\r\nyou will find clues to it all.’ Then suddenly the humour of the\r\nsituation came into my mind: the thought of the years I had spent in\r\nstudy and toil to get into the future age, and now my passion of\r\nanxiety to get out of it. I had made myself the most complicated and\r\nthe most hopeless trap that ever a man devised. Although it was at my\r\nown expense, I could not help myself. I laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n“Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little people\r\navoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had something to\r\ndo with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt tolerably sure\r\nof the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no concern and to\r\nabstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day or two\r\nthings got back to the old footing. I made what progress I could in the\r\nlanguage, and in addition I pushed my explorations here and there.\r\nEither I missed some subtle point or their language was excessively\r\nsimple—almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs.\r\nThere seemed to be few, if any, abstract terms, or little use of\r\nfigurative language. Their sentences were usually simple and of two\r\nwords, and I failed to convey or understand any but the simplest\r\npropositions. I determined to put the thought of my Time Machine and\r\nthe mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx, as much as possible\r\nin a corner of memory, until my growing knowledge would lead me back to\r\nthem in a natural way. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand,\r\ntethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.","updatedAt":"2018-07-19T06:39:08.829Z","createdAt":"2018-07-19T06:39:08.829Z"},{"number":11,"bookId":3,"html":"<h2> Explanation </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant\r\nrichness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the same\r\nabundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material and style,\r\nthe same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same blossom-laden trees\r\nand tree ferns. Here and there water shone like silver, and beyond, the\r\nland rose into blue undulating hills, and so faded into the serenity of the\r\nsky. A peculiar feature, which presently attracted my attention, was the\r\npresence of certain circular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very\r\ngreat depth. One lay by the path up the hill which I had followed during\r\nmy first walk. Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze, curiously\r\nwrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain. Sitting by the\r\nside of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness, I could\r\nsee no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection with a lighted\r\nmatch. But in all of them I heard a certain sound: a\r\nthud&mdash;thud&mdash;thud, like the beating of some big engine; and I\r\ndiscovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady current of air\r\nset down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper into the throat of\r\none, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was at once sucked swiftly\r\nout of sight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers\r\nstanding here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was often\r\njust such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a\r\nsun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong suggestion\r\nof an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose true import it\r\nwas difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to associate it with the\r\nsanitary apparatus of these people. It was an obvious conclusion, but it\r\nwas absolutely wrong.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;And here I must admit that I learnt very little of drains and\r\nbells and modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my time in\r\nthis real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and coming times\r\nwhich I have read, there is a vast amount of detail about building, and\r\nsocial arrangements, and so forth. But while such details are easy enough\r\nto obtain when the whole world is contained in one&rsquo;s imagination,\r\nthey are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid such realities as\r\nI found here. Conceive the tale of London which a negro, fresh from Central\r\nAfrica, would take back to his tribe! What would he know of railway\r\ncompanies, of social movements, of telephone and telegraph wires, of the\r\nParcels Delivery Company, and postal orders and the like? Yet we, at least,\r\nshould be willing enough to explain these things to him! And even of what\r\nhe knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or\r\nbelieve? Then, think how narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of\r\nour own times, and how wide the interval between myself and these of the\r\nGolden Age! I was sensible of much which was unseen, and which contributed\r\nto my comfort; but save for a general impression of automatic organisation,\r\nI fear I can convey very little of the difference to your mind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of\r\ncrematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me that,\r\npossibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere beyond the\r\nrange of my explorings. This, again, was a question I deliberately put to\r\nmyself, and my curiosity was at first entirely defeated upon the point. The\r\nthing puzzled me, and I was led to make a further remark, which puzzled me\r\nstill more: that aged and infirm among this people there were none.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an\r\nautomatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure. Yet I\r\ncould think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The several big\r\npalaces I had explored were mere living places, great dining-halls and\r\nsleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no appliances of any kind.\r\nYet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at times need\r\nrenewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, were fairly complex\r\nspecimens of metalwork. Somehow such things must be made. And the little\r\npeople displayed no vestige of a creative tendency. There were no shops, no\r\nworkshops, no sign of importations among them. They spent all their time in\r\nplaying gently, in bathing in the river, in making love in a half-playful\r\nfashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see how things were kept\r\ngoing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what,\r\nhad taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. <i>Why?</i> For\r\nthe life of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too, those\r\nflickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt&mdash;how shall I put\r\nit? Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and there in\r\nexcellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others made up of\r\nwords, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well, on the third day\r\nof my visit, that was how the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven\r\nHundred and One presented itself to me!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;That day, too, I made a friend&mdash;of a sort. It happened that,\r\nas I was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of\r\nthem was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main current\r\nran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer. It\r\nwill give you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in these\r\ncreatures, when I tell you that none made the slightest attempt to rescue\r\nthe weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes. When I\r\nrealised this, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a\r\npoint lower down, I caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land. A\r\nlittle rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round, and I had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her. I had got to\r\nsuch a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from\r\nher. In that, however, I was wrong.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little\r\nwoman, as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre from an\r\nexploration, and she received me with cries of delight and presented me\r\nwith a big garland of flowers&mdash;evidently made for me and me alone. The\r\nthing took my imagination. Very possibly I had been feeling desolate. At\r\nany rate I did my best to display my appreciation of the gift. We were soon\r\nseated together in a little stone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly\r\nof smiles. The creature&rsquo;s friendliness affected me exactly as a\r\nchild&rsquo;s might have done. We passed each other flowers, and she kissed\r\nmy hands. I did the same to hers. Then I tried talk, and found that her\r\nname was Weena, which, though I don&rsquo;t know what it meant, somehow\r\nseemed appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendship\r\nwhich lasted a week, and ended&mdash;as I will tell you!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always.\r\nShe tried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it\r\nwent to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and\r\ncalling after me rather plaintively. But the problems of the world had to\r\nbe mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come into the future to carry on\r\na miniature flirtation. Yet her distress when I left her was very great,\r\nher expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic, and I think,\r\naltogether, I had as much trouble as comfort from her devotion.\r\nNevertheless she was, somehow, a very great comfort. I thought it was mere\r\nchildish affection that made her cling to me. Until it was too late, I did\r\nnot clearly know what I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Nor until\r\nit was too late did I clearly understand what she was to me. For, by merely\r\nseeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that she cared for\r\nme, the little doll of a creature presently gave my return to the\r\nneighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling of coming home; and I\r\nwould watch for her tiny figure of white and gold so soon as I came over\r\nthe hill.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;It was from her, too, that I learnt that fear had not yet left\r\nthe world. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest\r\nconfidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made threatening\r\ngrimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she dreaded the dark,\r\ndreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness to her was the one thing\r\ndreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it set me thinking\r\nand observing. I discovered then, among other things, that these little\r\npeople gathered into the great houses after dark, and slept in droves. To\r\nenter upon them without a light was to put them into a tumult of\r\napprehension. I never found one out of doors, or one sleeping alone within\r\ndoors, after dark. Yet I was still such a blockhead that I missed the\r\nlesson of that fear, and in spite of Weena&rsquo;s distress, I insisted upon\r\nsleeping away from these slumbering multitudes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me\r\ntriumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including the\r\nlast night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm. But my story\r\nslips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been the night before\r\nher rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had been restless, dreaming\r\nmost disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea anemones were feeling\r\nover my face with their soft palps. I woke with a start, and with an odd\r\nfancy that some greyish animal had just rushed out of the chamber. I tried\r\nto get to sleep again, but I felt restless and uncomfortable. It was that\r\ndim grey hour when things are just creeping out of darkness, when\r\neverything is colourless and clear cut, and yet unreal. I got up, and went\r\ndown into the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in front of the\r\npalace. I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the\r\nsunrise.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first\r\npallor of dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky\r\nblack, the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless. And up\r\nthe hill I thought I could see ghosts. Three several times, as I scanned\r\nthe slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw a solitary white,\r\nape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near the\r\nruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body. They moved hastily. I\r\ndid not see what became of them. It seemed that they vanished among the\r\nbushes. The dawn was still indistinct, you must understand. I was feeling\r\nthat chill, uncertain, early-morning feeling you may have known. I doubted\r\nmy eyes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on\r\nand its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned the\r\nview keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were mere\r\ncreatures of the half-light. &lsquo;They must have been ghosts,&rsquo; I\r\nsaid; &lsquo;I wonder whence they dated.&rsquo; For a queer notion of Grant\r\nAllen&rsquo;s came into my head, and amused me. If each generation die and\r\nleave ghosts, he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with them.\r\nOn that theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight Hundred\r\nThousand Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four at once. But\r\nthe jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these figures all the\r\nmorning, until Weena&rsquo;s rescue drove them out of my head. I associated\r\nthem in some indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in my\r\nfirst passionate search for the Time Machine. But Weena was a pleasant\r\nsubstitute. Yet all the same, they were soon destined to take far deadlier\r\npossession of my mind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather\r\nof this Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun was\r\nhotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that the sun\r\nwill go on cooling steadily in the future. But people, unfamiliar with such\r\nspeculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget that the planets must\r\nultimately fall back one by one into the parent body. As these catastrophes\r\noccur, the sun will blaze with renewed energy; and it may be that some\r\ninner planet had suffered this fate. Whatever the reason, the fact remains\r\nthat the sun was very much hotter than we know it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Well, one very hot morning&mdash;my fourth, I think&mdash;as I\r\nwas seeking shelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the\r\ngreat house where I slept and fed, there happened this strange thing.\r\nClambering among these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery, whose\r\nend and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone. By contrast\r\nwith the brilliancy outside, it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me. I\r\nentered it groping, for the change from light to blackness made spots of\r\ncolour swim before me. Suddenly I halted spellbound. A pair of eyes,\r\nluminous by reflection against the daylight without, was watching me out of\r\nthe darkness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched\r\nmy hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was afraid to\r\nturn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity appeared\r\nto be living came to my mind. And then I remembered that strange terror of\r\nthe dark. Overcoming my fear to some extent, I advanced a step and spoke. I\r\nwill admit that my voice was harsh and ill-controlled. I put out my hand\r\nand touched something soft. At once the eyes darted sideways, and something\r\nwhite ran past me. I turned with my heart in my mouth, and saw a queer\r\nlittle ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiar manner, running\r\nacross the sunlit space behind me. It blundered against a block of granite,\r\nstaggered aside, and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath\r\nanother pile of ruined masonry.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a\r\ndull white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there was\r\nflaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it went too fast\r\nfor me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it ran on all fours, or\r\nonly with its forearms held very low. After an instant&rsquo;s pause I\r\nfollowed it into the second heap of ruins. I could not find it at first;\r\nbut, after a time in the profound obscurity, I came upon one of those round\r\nwell-like openings of which I have told you, half closed by a fallen\r\npillar. A sudden thought came to me. Could this Thing have vanished down\r\nthe shaft? I lit a match, and, looking down, I saw a small, white, moving\r\ncreature, with large bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it\r\nretreated. It made me shudder. It was so like a human spider! It was\r\nclambering down the wall, and now I saw for the first time a number of\r\nmetal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft. Then the\r\nlight burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it dropped,\r\nand when I had lit another the little monster had disappeared.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not\r\nfor some time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I\r\nhad seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that Man had\r\nnot remained one species, but had differentiated into two distinct animals:\r\nthat my graceful children of the Upper World were not the sole descendants\r\nof our generation, but that this bleached, obscene, nocturnal Thing, which\r\nhad flashed before me, was also heir to all the ages.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an\r\nunderground ventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And what, I\r\nwondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced\r\norganisation? How was it related to the indolent serenity of the beautiful\r\nOverworlders? And what was hidden down there, at the foot of that shaft?\r\nI sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that, at any rate, there was\r\nnothing to fear, and that there I must descend for the solution of my\r\ndifficulties. And withal I was absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two\r\nof the beautiful upperworld people came running in their amorous sport\r\nacross the daylight in the shadow. The male pursued the female, flinging\r\nflowers at her as he ran.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned\r\npillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form to\r\nremark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried to frame\r\na question about it in their tongue, they were still more visibly\r\ndistressed and turned away. But they were interested by my matches, and I\r\nstruck some to amuse them. I tried them again about the well, and again I\r\nfailed. So presently I left them, meaning to go back to Weena, and see what\r\nI could get from her. But my mind was already in revolution; my guesses and\r\nimpressions were slipping and sliding to a new adjustment. I had now a clue\r\nto the import of these wells, to the ventilating towers, to the mystery of\r\nthe ghosts; to say nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and\r\nthe fate of the Time Machine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion\r\ntowards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was\r\nsubterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which made me\r\nthink that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a\r\nlong-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was the\r\nbleached look common in most animals that live largely in the\r\ndark&mdash;the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then, those\r\nlarge eyes, with that capacity for reflecting light, are common features of\r\nnocturnal things&mdash;witness the owl and the cat. And last of all, that\r\nevident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty yet fumbling awkward flight\r\ntowards dark shadow, and that peculiar carriage of the head while in the\r\nlight&mdash;all reinforced the theory of an extreme sensitiveness of the\r\nretina.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously,\r\nand these tunnellings were the habitat of the New Race. The presence of\r\nventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes&mdash;everywhere, in\r\nfact, except along the river valley&mdash;showed how universal were its\r\nramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in this\r\nartificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of the\r\ndaylight race was done? The notion was so plausible that I at once accepted\r\nit, and went on to assume the <i>how</i> of this splitting of the human\r\nspecies. I dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory; though, for\r\nmyself, I very soon felt that it fell far short of the truth.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed\r\nclear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely\r\ntemporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer\r\nwas the key to the whole position. No doubt it will seem grotesque enough\r\nto you&mdash;and wildly incredible!&mdash;and yet even now there are\r\nexisting circumstances to point that way. There is a tendency to utilise\r\nunderground space for the less ornamental purposes of civilisation; there\r\nis the Metropolitan Railway in London, for instance, there are new electric\r\nrailways, there are subways, there are underground workrooms and\r\nrestaurants, and they increase and multiply. Evidently, I thought, this\r\ntendency had increased till Industry had gradually lost its birthright in\r\nthe sky. I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever\r\nlarger underground factories, spending a still-increasing amount of its\r\ntime therein, till, in the end&mdash;! Even now, does not an East-end\r\nworker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut off from\r\nthe natural surface of the earth?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people&mdash;due, no\r\ndoubt, to the increasing refinement of their education, and the widening\r\ngulf between them and the rude violence of the poor&mdash;is already\r\nleading to the closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the\r\nsurface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the prettier\r\ncountry is shut in against intrusion. And this same widening\r\ngulf&mdash;which is due to the length and expense of the higher educational\r\nprocess and the increased facilities for and temptations towards refined\r\nhabits on the part of the rich&mdash;will make that exchange between class\r\nand class, that promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the\r\nsplitting of our species along lines of social stratification, less and\r\nless frequent. So, in the end, above ground you must have the Haves,\r\npursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below ground the Have-nots,\r\nthe Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of their labour.\r\nOnce they were there, they would no doubt have to pay rent, and not a\r\nlittle of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused,\r\nthey would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of them as were so\r\nconstituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in the end,\r\nthe balance being permanent, the survivors would become as well adapted to\r\nthe conditions of underground life, and as happy in their way, as the\r\nOverworld people were to theirs. As it seemed to me, the refined beauty\r\nand the etiolated pallor followed naturally enough.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different\r\nshape in my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and\r\ngeneral co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real aristocracy,\r\narmed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the\r\nindustrial system of today. Its triumph had not been simply a triumph over\r\nNature, but a triumph over Nature and the fellow-man. This, I must warn\r\nyou, was my theory at the time. I had no convenient cicerone in the pattern\r\nof the Utopian books. My explanation may be absolutely wrong. I still think\r\nit is the most plausible one. But even on this supposition the balanced\r\ncivilisation that was at last attained must have long since passed its\r\nzenith, and was now far fallen into decay. The too-perfect security of the\r\nOverworlders had led them to a slow movement of degeneration, to a\r\ngeneral dwindling in size, strength, and intelligence. That I could see\r\nclearly enough already. What had happened to the Undergrounders I did not\r\nyet suspect; but, from what I had seen of the Morlocks&mdash;that, by the\r\nbye, was the name by which these creatures were called&mdash;I could imagine\r\nthat the modification of the human type was even far more profound than\r\namong the &lsquo;Eloi,&rsquo; the beautiful race that I already knew.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time\r\nMachine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if the\r\nEloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And why were\r\nthey so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have said, to\r\nquestion Weena about this Underworld, but here again I was disappointed.\r\nAt first she would not understand my questions, and presently she refused\r\nto answer them. She shivered as though the topic was unendurable. And when\r\nI pressed her, perhaps a little harshly, she burst into tears. They were\r\nthe only tears, except my own, I ever saw in that Golden Age. When I saw\r\nthem I ceased abruptly to trouble about the Morlocks, and was only\r\nconcerned in banishing these signs of her human inheritance from\r\nWeena&rsquo;s eyes. And very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands,\r\nwhile I solemnly burnt a match.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"chap09\"></a></p> <h3> IX </h3>\r\n\r\n","text":"VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation\r\n\r\n“So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant\r\nrichness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the same\r\nabundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material and\r\nstyle, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same\r\nblossom-laden trees and tree ferns. Here and there water shone like\r\nsilver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and so\r\nfaded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which presently\r\nattracted my attention, was the presence of certain circular wells,\r\nseveral, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth. One lay by the path\r\nup the hill which I had followed during my first walk. Like the others,\r\nit was rimmed with bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little\r\ncupola from the rain. Sitting by the side of these wells, and peering\r\ndown into the shafted darkness, I could see no gleam of water, nor\r\ncould I start any reflection with a lighted match. But in all of them I\r\nheard a certain sound: a thud—thud—thud, like the beating of some big\r\nengine; and I discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady\r\ncurrent of air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper\r\ninto the throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was\r\nat once sucked swiftly out of sight.\r\n\r\n“After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers\r\nstanding here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was often\r\njust such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a\r\nsun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong\r\nsuggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose\r\ntrue import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to\r\nassociate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an\r\nobvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong.\r\n\r\n“And here I must admit that I learnt very little of drains and bells\r\nand modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my time in\r\nthis real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and coming times\r\nwhich I have read, there is a vast amount of detail about building, and\r\nsocial arrangements, and so forth. But while such details are easy\r\nenough to obtain when the whole world is contained in one’s\r\nimagination, they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid\r\nsuch realities as I found here. Conceive the tale of London which a\r\nnegro, fresh from Central Africa, would take back to his tribe! What\r\nwould he know of railway companies, of social movements, of telephone\r\nand telegraph wires, of the Parcels Delivery Company, and postal orders\r\nand the like? Yet we, at least, should be willing enough to explain\r\nthese things to him! And even of what he knew, how much could he make\r\nhis untravelled friend either apprehend or believe? Then, think how\r\nnarrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times, and\r\nhow wide the interval between myself and these of the Golden Age! I was\r\nsensible of much which was unseen, and which contributed to my comfort;\r\nbut save for a general impression of automatic organisation, I fear I\r\ncan convey very little of the difference to your mind.\r\n\r\n“In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of\r\ncrematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me\r\nthat, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere\r\nbeyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I\r\ndeliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely\r\ndefeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make a\r\nfurther remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm among\r\nthis people there were none.\r\n\r\n“I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an\r\nautomatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure. Yet\r\nI could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The several big\r\npalaces I had explored were mere living places, great dining-halls and\r\nsleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no appliances of any\r\nkind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at\r\ntimes need renewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, were fairly\r\ncomplex specimens of metalwork. Somehow such things must be made. And\r\nthe little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency. There\r\nwere no shops, no workshops, no sign of importations among them. They\r\nspent all their time in playing gently, in bathing in the river, in\r\nmaking love in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I\r\ncould not see how things were kept going.\r\n\r\n“Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what, had\r\ntaken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. _Why?_ For the\r\nlife of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too, those\r\nflickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt—how shall I put it?\r\nSuppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and there in\r\nexcellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others made up of\r\nwords, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well, on the third\r\nday of my visit, that was how the world of Eight Hundred and Two\r\nThousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to me!\r\n\r\n“That day, too, I made a friend—of a sort. It happened that, as I was\r\nwatching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them\r\nwas seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main current\r\nran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer.\r\nIt will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in these\r\ncreatures, when I tell you that none made the slightest attempt to\r\nrescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their\r\neyes. When I realised this, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, and,\r\nwading in at a point lower down, I caught the poor mite and drew her\r\nsafe to land. A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round, and\r\nI had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her. I\r\nhad got to such a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any\r\ngratitude from her. In that, however, I was wrong.\r\n\r\n“This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little woman,\r\nas I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre from an\r\nexploration, and she received me with cries of delight and presented me\r\nwith a big garland of flowers—evidently made for me and me alone. The\r\nthing took my imagination. Very possibly I had been feeling desolate.\r\nAt any rate I did my best to display my appreciation of the gift. We\r\nwere soon seated together in a little stone arbour, engaged in\r\nconversation, chiefly of smiles. The creature’s friendliness affected\r\nme exactly as a child’s might have done. We passed each other flowers,\r\nand she kissed my hands. I did the same to hers. Then I tried talk, and\r\nfound that her name was Weena, which, though I don’t know what it\r\nmeant, somehow seemed appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a\r\nqueer friendship which lasted a week, and ended—as I will tell you!\r\n\r\n“She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She\r\ntried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it\r\nwent to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and\r\ncalling after me rather plaintively. But the problems of the world had\r\nto be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come into the future to\r\ncarry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress when I left her was\r\nvery great, her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic,\r\nand I think, altogether, I had as much trouble as comfort from her\r\ndevotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow, a very great comfort. I\r\nthought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me. Until\r\nit was too late, I did not clearly know what I had inflicted upon her\r\nwhen I left her. Nor until it was too late did I clearly understand\r\nwhat she was to me. For, by merely seeming fond of me, and showing in\r\nher weak, futile way that she cared for me, the little doll of a\r\ncreature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the White\r\nSphinx almost the feeling of coming home; and I would watch for her\r\ntiny figure of white and gold so soon as I came over the hill.\r\n\r\n“It was from her, too, that I learnt that fear had not yet left the\r\nworld. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest\r\nconfidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made threatening\r\ngrimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she dreaded the\r\ndark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness to her was the\r\none thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it set\r\nme thinking and observing. I discovered then, among other things, that\r\nthese little people gathered into the great houses after dark, and\r\nslept in droves. To enter upon them without a light was to put them\r\ninto a tumult of apprehension. I never found one out of doors, or one\r\nsleeping alone within doors, after dark. Yet I was still such a\r\nblockhead that I missed the lesson of that fear, and in spite of\r\nWeena’s distress, I insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering\r\nmultitudes.\r\n\r\n“It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me\r\ntriumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including\r\nthe last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm. But\r\nmy story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been the\r\nnight before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had been\r\nrestless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea\r\nanemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps. I woke with a\r\nstart, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed\r\nout of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again, but I felt restless\r\nand uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour when things are just\r\ncreeping out of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut,\r\nand yet unreal. I got up, and went down into the great hall, and so out\r\nupon the flagstones in front of the palace. I thought I would make a\r\nvirtue of necessity, and see the sunrise.\r\n\r\n“The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of\r\ndawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky black,\r\nthe ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless. And up the\r\nhill I thought I could see ghosts. Three several times, as I scanned\r\nthe slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw a solitary white,\r\nape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near the\r\nruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body. They moved\r\nhastily. I did not see what became of them. It seemed that they\r\nvanished among the bushes. The dawn was still indistinct, you must\r\nunderstand. I was feeling that chill, uncertain, early-morning feeling\r\nyou may have known. I doubted my eyes.\r\n\r\n“As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on and\r\nits vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned the\r\nview keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were mere\r\ncreatures of the half-light. ‘They must have been ghosts,’ I said; ‘I\r\nwonder whence they dated.’ For a queer notion of Grant Allen’s came\r\ninto my head, and amused me. If each generation die and leave ghosts,\r\nhe argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with them. On that\r\ntheory they would have grown innumerable some Eight Hundred Thousand\r\nYears hence, and it was no great wonder to see four at once. But the\r\njest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these figures all the\r\nmorning, until Weena’s rescue drove them out of my head. I associated\r\nthem in some indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in my\r\nfirst passionate search for the Time Machine. But Weena was a pleasant\r\nsubstitute. Yet all the same, they were soon destined to take far\r\ndeadlier possession of my mind.\r\n\r\n“I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of\r\nthis Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun was\r\nhotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that the sun\r\nwill go on cooling steadily in the future. But people, unfamiliar with\r\nsuch speculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget that the\r\nplanets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body. As\r\nthese catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze with renewed energy; and\r\nit may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate. Whatever the\r\nreason, the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Well, one very hot morning—my fourth, I think—as I was seeking shelter\r\nfrom the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where I\r\nslept and fed, there happened this strange thing. Clambering among\r\nthese heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery, whose end and side\r\nwindows were blocked by fallen masses of stone. By contrast with the\r\nbrilliancy outside, it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me. I\r\nentered it groping, for the change from light to blackness made spots\r\nof colour swim before me. Suddenly I halted spellbound. A pair of eyes,\r\nluminous by reflection against the daylight without, was watching me\r\nout of the darkness.\r\n\r\n“The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched my\r\nhands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was afraid to\r\nturn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity\r\nappeared to be living came to my mind. And then I remembered that\r\nstrange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to some extent, I\r\nadvanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my voice was harsh and\r\nill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched something soft. At once\r\nthe eyes darted sideways, and something white ran past me. I turned\r\nwith my heart in my mouth, and saw a queer little ape-like figure, its\r\nhead held down in a peculiar manner, running across the sunlit space\r\nbehind me. It blundered against a block of granite, staggered aside,\r\nand in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of\r\nruined masonry.\r\n\r\n“My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a dull\r\nwhite, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there was\r\nflaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it went too\r\nfast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it ran on all\r\nfours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an instant’s\r\npause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could not find it\r\nat first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I came upon one\r\nof those round well-like openings of which I have told you, half closed\r\nby a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me. Could this Thing have\r\nvanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and, looking down, I saw a\r\nsmall, white, moving creature, with large bright eyes which regarded me\r\nsteadfastly as it retreated. It made me shudder. It was so like a human\r\nspider! It was clambering down the wall, and now I saw for the first\r\ntime a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder\r\ndown the shaft. Then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my\r\nhand, going out as it dropped, and when I had lit another the little\r\nmonster had disappeared.\r\n\r\n“I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for\r\nsome time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I\r\nhad seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that Man\r\nhad not remained one species, but had differentiated into two distinct\r\nanimals: that my graceful children of the Upper World were not the sole\r\ndescendants of our generation, but that this bleached, obscene,\r\nnocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir to all the\r\nages.\r\n\r\n“I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground\r\nventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And what, I\r\nwondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced\r\norganisation? How was it related to the indolent serenity of the\r\nbeautiful Overworlders? And what was hidden down there, at the foot of\r\nthat shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that, at any\r\nrate, there was nothing to fear, and that there I must descend for the\r\nsolution of my difficulties. And withal I was absolutely afraid to go!\r\nAs I hesitated, two of the beautiful upperworld people came running in\r\ntheir amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow. The male pursued\r\nthe female, flinging flowers at her as he ran.\r\n\r\n“They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned\r\npillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form to\r\nremark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried to\r\nframe a question about it in their tongue, they were still more visibly\r\ndistressed and turned away. But they were interested by my matches, and\r\nI struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about the well, and\r\nagain I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to go back to Weena,\r\nand see what I could get from her. But my mind was already in\r\nrevolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a\r\nnew adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these wells, to the\r\nventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to say nothing of a\r\nhint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the Time\r\nMachine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution\r\nof the economic problem that had puzzled me.\r\n\r\n“Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was\r\nsubterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which made\r\nme think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a\r\nlong-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was the\r\nbleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark—the\r\nwhite fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then, those large eyes,\r\nwith that capacity for reflecting light, are common features of\r\nnocturnal things—witness the owl and the cat. And last of all, that\r\nevident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty yet fumbling awkward\r\nflight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar carriage of the head\r\nwhile in the light—all reinforced the theory of an extreme\r\nsensitiveness of the retina.\r\n\r\n“Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and\r\nthese tunnellings were the habitat of the New Race. The presence of\r\nventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes—everywhere, in fact,\r\nexcept along the river valley—showed how universal were its\r\nramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in this\r\nartificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of\r\nthe daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible that I at once\r\naccepted it, and went on to assume the _how_ of this splitting of the\r\nhuman species. I dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory;\r\nthough, for myself, I very soon felt that it fell far short of the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n“At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed clear\r\nas daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely\r\ntemporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer\r\nwas the key to the whole position. No doubt it will seem grotesque\r\nenough to you—and wildly incredible!—and yet even now there are\r\nexisting circumstances to point that way. There is a tendency to\r\nutilise underground space for the less ornamental purposes of\r\ncivilisation; there is the Metropolitan Railway in London, for\r\ninstance, there are new electric railways, there are subways, there are\r\nunderground workrooms and restaurants, and they increase and multiply.\r\nEvidently, I thought, this tendency had increased till Industry had\r\ngradually lost its birthright in the sky. I mean that it had gone\r\ndeeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories,\r\nspending a still-increasing amount of its time therein, till, in the\r\nend—! Even now, does not an East-end worker live in such artificial\r\nconditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the\r\nearth?\r\n\r\n“Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people—due, no doubt, to the\r\nincreasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf between\r\nthem and the rude violence of the poor—is already leading to the\r\nclosing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the surface of\r\nthe land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the prettier country\r\nis shut in against intrusion. And this same widening gulf—which is due\r\nto the length and expense of the higher educational process and the\r\nincreased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the\r\npart of the rich—will make that exchange between class and class, that\r\npromotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of\r\nour species along lines of social stratification, less and less\r\nfrequent. So, in the end, above ground you must have the Haves,\r\npursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below ground the\r\nHave-nots, the Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of\r\ntheir labour. Once they were there, they would no doubt have to pay\r\nrent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and\r\nif they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such\r\nof them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would\r\ndie; and, in the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would\r\nbecome as well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as\r\nhappy in their way, as the Overworld people were to theirs. As it\r\nseemed to me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed\r\nnaturally enough.\r\n\r\n“The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different shape\r\nin my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and general\r\nco-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real aristocracy,\r\narmed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the\r\nindustrial system of today. Its triumph had not been simply a triumph\r\nover Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the fellow-man. This, I must\r\nwarn you, was my theory at the time. I had no convenient cicerone in\r\nthe pattern of the Utopian books. My explanation may be absolutely\r\nwrong. I still think it is the most plausible one. But even on this\r\nsupposition the balanced civilisation that was at last attained must\r\nhave long since passed its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay.\r\nThe too-perfect security of the Overworlders had led them to a slow\r\nmovement of degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and\r\nintelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had\r\nhappened to the Undergrounders I did not yet suspect; but, from what I\r\nhad seen of the Morlocks—that, by the bye, was the name by which these\r\ncreatures were called—I could imagine that the modification of the\r\nhuman type was even far more profound than among the ‘Eloi,’ the\r\nbeautiful race that I already knew.\r\n\r\n“Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time\r\nMachine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if the\r\nEloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And why\r\nwere they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have said,\r\nto question Weena about this Underworld, but here again I was\r\ndisappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and\r\npresently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the topic\r\nwas unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little harshly, she\r\nburst into tears. They were the only tears, except my own, I ever saw\r\nin that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased abruptly to trouble about\r\nthe Morlocks, and was only concerned in banishing these signs of her\r\nhuman inheritance from Weena’s eyes. And very soon she was smiling and\r\nclapping her hands, while I solemnly burnt a match.","updatedAt":"2018-07-19T06:39:08.829Z","createdAt":"2018-07-19T06:39:08.829Z"},{"number":12,"bookId":3,"html":"<h2> The Morlocks </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow\r\nup the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt a\r\npeculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the\r\nhalf-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in spirit\r\nin a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the touch. Probably\r\nmy shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the Eloi,\r\nwhose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to appreciate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a\r\nlittle disordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once or twice\r\nI had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive no definite\r\nreason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the\r\nlittle people were sleeping in the moonlight&mdash;that night Weena was\r\namong them&mdash;and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me\r\neven then, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its\r\nlast quarter, and the nights grow dark, when the appearances of these\r\nunpleasant creatures from below, these whitened Lemurs, this new vermin\r\nthat had replaced the old, might be more abundant. And on both these days I\r\nhad the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty. I felt\r\nassured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by boldly\r\npenetrating these mysteries of underground. Yet I could not face the mystery.\r\nIf only I had had a companion it would have been different. But I was so\r\nhorribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness of the well\r\nappalled me. I don&rsquo;t know if you will understand my feeling, but I\r\nnever felt quite safe at my back.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me\r\nfarther and farther afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the\r\nsouth-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe Wood, I\r\nobserved far-off, in the direction of nineteenth-century Banstead, a vast\r\ngreen structure, different in character from any I had hitherto seen. It\r\nwas larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins I knew, and the façade\r\nhad an Oriental look: the face of it having the lustre, as well as the\r\npale-green tint, a kind of bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese\r\nporcelain. This difference in aspect suggested a difference in use, and I\r\nwas minded to push on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had\r\ncome upon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so I\r\nresolved to hold over the adventure for the following day, and I returned\r\nto the welcome and the caresses of little Weena. But next morning I\r\nperceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the Palace of Green\r\nPorcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enable me to shirk, by another\r\nday, an experience I dreaded. I resolved I would make the descent without\r\nfurther waste of time, and started out in the early morning towards a well\r\nnear the ruins of granite and aluminium.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but when\r\nshe saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed strangely\r\ndisconcerted. &lsquo;Good-bye, little Weena,&rsquo; I said, kissing her;\r\nand then putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet for the\r\nclimbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for I feared my\r\ncourage might leak away! At first she watched me in amazement. Then she\r\ngave a most piteous cry, and running to me, she began to pull at me with\r\nher little hands. I think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed. I\r\nshook her off, perhaps a little roughly, and in another moment I was in the\r\nthroat of the well. I saw her agonised face over the parapet, and smiled to\r\nreassure her. Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks to which I\r\nclung.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The\r\ndescent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides of\r\nthe well, and these being adapted to the needs of a creature much smaller\r\nand lighter than myself, I was speedily cramped and fatigued by the\r\ndescent. And not simply fatigued! One of the bars bent suddenly under my\r\nweight, and almost swung me off into the blackness beneath. For a moment I\r\nhung by one hand, and after that experience I did not dare to rest again.\r\nThough my arms and back were presently acutely painful, I went on\r\nclambering down the sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible.\r\nGlancing upward, I saw the aperture, a small blue disc, in which a star was\r\nvisible, while little Weena&rsquo;s head showed as a round black\r\nprojection. The thudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more\r\noppressive. Everything save that little disc above was profoundly dark, and\r\nwhen I looked up again Weena had disappeared.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to\r\ngo up the shaft again, and leave the Underworld alone. But even while I\r\nturned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with intense\r\nrelief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a slender\r\nloophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the aperture of a\r\nnarrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and rest. It was not too\r\nsoon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I was trembling with the\r\nprolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the unbroken darkness had had a\r\ndistressing effect upon my eyes. The air was full of the throb and hum of\r\nmachinery pumping air down the shaft.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I do not know how long I lay. I was arroused by a soft hand\r\ntouching my face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and,\r\nhastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar to the\r\none I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating before the\r\nlight. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me impenetrable darkness,\r\ntheir eyes were abnormally large and sensitive, just as are the pupils of\r\nthe abysmal fishes, and they reflected the light in the same way. I have no\r\ndoubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to\r\nhave any fear of me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match\r\nin order to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark gutters\r\nand tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest\r\nfashion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently\r\ndifferent from that of the Overworld people; so that I was needs left to\r\nmy own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before exploration was\r\neven then in my mind. But I said to myself, &lsquo;You are in for it\r\nnow,&rsquo; and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the noise of\r\nmachinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from me, and I came to\r\na large open space, and striking another match, saw that I had entered a\r\nvast arched cavern, which stretched into utter darkness beyond the range of\r\nmy light. The view I had of it was as much as one could see in the burning\r\nof a match.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines\r\nrose out of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim\r\nspectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the bye, was very\r\nstuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly-shed blood was in\r\nthe air. Some way down the central vista was a little table of white metal,\r\nlaid with what seemed a meal. The Morlocks at any rate were carnivorous!\r\nEven at the time, I remember wondering what large animal could have\r\nsurvived to furnish the red joint I saw. It was all very indistinct: the\r\nheavy smell, the big unmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the\r\nshadows, and only waiting for the darkness to come at me again! Then the\r\nmatch burnt down, and stung my fingers, and fell, a wriggling red spot in\r\nthe blackness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such\r\nan experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had started with\r\nthe absurd assumption that the men of the Future would certainly be\r\ninfinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances. I had come without\r\narms, without medicine, without anything to smoke&mdash;at times I missed\r\ntobacco frightfully!&mdash;even without enough matches. If only I had\r\nthought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse of the Underworld in\r\na second, and examined it at leisure. But, as it was, I stood there with\r\nonly the weapons and the powers that Nature had endowed me\r\nwith&mdash;hands, feet, and teeth; these, and four safety-matches that\r\nstill remained to me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the\r\ndark, and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered that my\r\nstore of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me until that moment\r\nthat there was any need to economise them, and I had wasted almost half the\r\nbox in astonishing the Overworlders, to whom fire was a novelty. Now, as\r\nI say, I had four left, and while I stood in the dark, a hand touched mine,\r\nlank fingers came feeling over my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar\r\nunpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those\r\ndreadful little beings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being\r\ngently disengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The\r\nsense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably unpleasant.\r\nThe sudden realisation of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing\r\ncame home to me very vividly in the darkness. I shouted at them as loudly\r\nas I could. They started away, and then I could feel them approaching me\r\nagain. They clutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds to each\r\nother. I shivered violently, and shouted again&mdash;rather discordantly.\r\nThis time they were not so seriously alarmed, and they made a queer\r\nlaughing noise as they came back at me. I will confess I was horribly\r\nfrightened. I determined to strike another match and escape under the\r\nprotection of its glare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap\r\nof paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But I\r\nhad scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the blackness I\r\ncould hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves, and pattering like\r\nthe rain, as they hurried after me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no\r\nmistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another light,\r\nand waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine how\r\nnauseatingly inhuman they looked&mdash;those pale, chinless faces and\r\ngreat, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!&mdash;as they stared in their blindness\r\nand bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise you: I retreated\r\nagain, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third. It had almost\r\nburnt through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay down on the\r\nedge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy. Then I felt\r\nsideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped\r\nfrom behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I lit my last match … and\r\nit incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now, and,\r\nkicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the Morlocks,\r\nand was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed peering and\r\nblinking up at me: all but one little wretch who followed me for some way,\r\nand well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or\r\nthirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest\r\ndifficulty in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful struggle\r\nagainst this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I felt all the\r\nsensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the well-mouth somehow,\r\nand staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight. I fell upon my\r\nface. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean. Then I remember Weena kissing my\r\nhands and ears, and the voices of others among the Eloi. Then, for a time,\r\nI was insensible.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"chap10\"></a></p> <h3> X </h3>\r\n\r\n","text":"IX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Morlocks\r\n\r\n“It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow up\r\nthe new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt a\r\npeculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the\r\nhalf-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in\r\nspirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the\r\ntouch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic\r\ninfluence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to\r\nappreciate.\r\n\r\n“The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a little\r\ndisordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once or twice I\r\nhad a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive no definite\r\nreason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the\r\nlittle people were sleeping in the moonlight—that night Weena was among\r\nthem—and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me even\r\nthen, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its\r\nlast quarter, and the nights grow dark, when the appearances of these\r\nunpleasant creatures from below, these whitened Lemurs, this new vermin\r\nthat had replaced the old, might be more abundant. And on both these\r\ndays I had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty. I\r\nfelt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by boldly\r\npenetrating these mysteries of underground. Yet I could not face the\r\nmystery. If only I had had a companion it would have been different.\r\nBut I was so horribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness\r\nof the well appalled me. I don’t know if you will understand my\r\nfeeling, but I never felt quite safe at my back.\r\n\r\n“It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me\r\nfarther and farther afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the\r\nsouth-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe\r\nWood, I observed far-off, in the direction of nineteenth-century\r\nBanstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any I had\r\nhitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins I\r\nknew, and the façade had an Oriental look: the face of it having the\r\nlustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind of bluish-green, of a\r\ncertain type of Chinese porcelain. This difference in aspect suggested\r\na difference in use, and I was minded to push on and explore. But the\r\nday was growing late, and I had come upon the sight of the place after\r\na long and tiring circuit; so I resolved to hold over the adventure for\r\nthe following day, and I returned to the welcome and the caresses of\r\nlittle Weena.

Though my arms and back were presently\r\nacutely painful, I went on clambering down the sheer descent with as\r\nquick a motion as possible.

My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I\r\nwas trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the\r\nunbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes.

Hitherto,\r\nexcept during my night&rsquo;s anguish at the loss of the Time Machine, I\r\nhad felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was staggered\r\nby these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought myself impeded by\r\nthe childish simplicity of the little people, and by some unknown forces\r\nwhich I had only to understand to overcome; but there was an altogether new\r\nelement in the sickening quality of the Morlocks&mdash;a something inhuman\r\nand malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, I had felt as a man might\r\nfeel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get\r\nout of it. Now I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy would come upon\r\nhim soon.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the\r\nnew moon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible\r\nremarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now such a very difficult problem\r\nto guess what the coming Dark Nights might mean. The moon was on the wane:\r\neach night there was a longer interval of darkness. And I now understood to\r\nsome slight degree at least the reason of the fear of the little\r\nUpperworld people for the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it\r\nmight be that the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure now\r\nthat my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upperworld people might once\r\nhave been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their mechanical\r\nservants: but that had long since passed away. The two species that had\r\nresulted from the evolution of man were sliding down towards, or had\r\nalready arrived at, an altogether new relationship. The Eloi, like the\r\nCarlovignan kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful futility. They still\r\npossessed the earth on sufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for\r\ninnumerable generations, had come at last to find the daylit surface\r\nintolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and\r\nmaintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the survival of an\r\nold habit of service. They did it as a standing horse paws with his foot,\r\nor as a man enjoys killing animals in sport: because ancient and departed\r\nnecessities had impressed it on the organism. But, clearly, the old order\r\nwas already in part reversed. The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping\r\non apace. Ages ago, thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his\r\nbrother man out of the ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was\r\ncoming back&mdash;changed! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson\r\nanew. They were becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came\r\ninto my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the Underworld. It\r\nseemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were by the\r\ncurrent of my meditations, but coming in almost like a question from\r\noutside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had a vague sense of something\r\nfamiliar, but I could not tell what it was at the time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of\r\ntheir mysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this\r\nage of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not paralyse\r\nand mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend myself. Without\r\nfurther delay I determined to make myself arms and a fastness where I might\r\nsleep. With that refuge as a base, I could face this strange world with\r\nsome of that confidence I had lost in realising to what creatures night by\r\nnight I lay exposed. I felt I could never sleep again until my bed was\r\nsecure from them. I shuddered with horror to think how they must already\r\nhave examined me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames,\r\nbut found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All the\r\nbuildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers as\r\nthe Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the tall pinnacles of\r\nthe Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished gleam of its walls came back\r\nto my memory; and in the evening, taking Weena like a child upon my\r\nshoulder, I went up the hills towards the south-west. The distance, I had\r\nreckoned, was seven or eight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen.\r\nI had first seen the place on a moist afternoon when distances are\r\ndeceptively diminished. In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose,\r\nand a nail was working through the sole&mdash;they were comfortable old\r\nshoes I wore about indoors&mdash;so that I was lame. And it was already\r\nlong past sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black\r\nagainst the pale yellow of the sky.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but\r\nafter a while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the side of\r\nme, occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my\r\npockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at the last she had\r\nconcluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases for floral decoration.\r\nAt least she utilised them for that purpose.

Then he resumed his narrative.</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over\r\nthe hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to return to\r\nthe house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the\r\nPalace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand that\r\nwe were seeking a refuge there from her Fear. You know that great pause\r\nthat comes upon things before the dusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees.\r\nTo me there is always an air of expectation about that evening stillness.\r\nThe sky was clear, remote, and empty save for a few horizontal bars far\r\ndown in the sunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my\r\nfears. In that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally sharpened. I\r\nfancied I could even feel the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet:\r\ncould, indeed, almost see through it the Morlocks on their ant-hill going\r\nhither and thither and waiting for the dark. In my excitement I fancied\r\nthat they would receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of\r\nwar. And why had they taken my Time Machine?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night.\r\nThe clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another came out.\r\nThe ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena&rsquo;s fears and her\r\nfatigue grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed\r\nher. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her arms round my neck,\r\nand, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face against my shoulder. So we\r\nwent down a long slope into a valley, and there in the dimness I almost\r\nwalked into a little river. This I waded, and went up the opposite side of\r\nthe valley, past a number of sleeping houses, and by a statue&mdash;a Faun,\r\nor some such figure, <i>minus</i> the head. Here too were acacias. So far I\r\nhad seen nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and\r\nthe darker hours before the old moon rose were still to come.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide and\r\nblack before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either to\r\nthe right or the left. Feeling tired&mdash;my feet, in particular, were\r\nvery sore&mdash;I carefully lowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted, and\r\nsat down upon the turf. I could no longer see the Palace of Green\r\nPorcelain, and I was in doubt of my direction. I looked into the thickness\r\nof the wood and thought of what it might hide. Under that dense tangle of\r\nbranches one would be out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other\r\nlurking danger&mdash;a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose\r\nupon&mdash;there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the\r\ntree-boles to strike against. I was very tired, too, after the excitements\r\nof the day; so I decided that I would not face it, but would pass the night\r\nupon the open hill.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped\r\nher in my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The\r\nhillside was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood there came\r\nnow and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the stars, for the\r\nnight was very clear. I felt a certain sense of friendly comfort in their\r\ntwinkling. All the old constellations had gone from the sky, however: that\r\nslow movement which is imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had long\r\nsince rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, it seemed\r\nto me, was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as of yore.\r\nSouthward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star that was new to me;\r\nit was even more splendid than our own green Sirius. And amid all these\r\nscintillating points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily\r\nlike the face of an old friend.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all\r\nthe gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable\r\ndistance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the\r\nunknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great precessional\r\ncycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty times had that\r\nsilent revolution occurred during all the years that I had traversed. And\r\nduring these few revolutions all the activity, all the traditions, the\r\ncomplex organisations, the nations, languages, literatures, aspirations,\r\neven the mere memory of Man as I knew him, had been swept out of existence.\r\nInstead were these frail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry,\r\nand the white Things of which I went in terror. Then I thought of the Great\r\nFear that was between the two species, and for the first time, with a\r\nsudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen might\r\nbe. Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me,\r\nher face white and starlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the\r\nthought.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well\r\nas I could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs\r\nof the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept very clear,\r\nexcept for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at times. Then, as my vigil\r\nwore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the reflection of some\r\ncolourless fire, and the old moon rose, thin and peaked and white. And\r\nclose behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at\r\nfirst, and then growing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us.\r\nIndeed, I had seen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence of\r\nrenewed day it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable. I\r\nstood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle and\r\npainful under the heel; so I sat down again, took off my shoes, and flung\r\nthem away.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and\r\npleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit wherewith to\r\nbreak our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones, laughing and dancing\r\nin the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as the night.\r\nAnd then I thought once more of the meat that I had seen. I felt assured\r\nnow of what it was, and from the bottom of my heart I pitied this last\r\nfeeble rill from the great flood of humanity. Clearly, at some time in the\r\nLong-Ago of human decay the Morlocks&rsquo; food had run short. Possibly\r\nthey had lived on rats and such-like vermin. Even now man is far less\r\ndiscriminating and exclusive in his food than he was&mdash;far less than\r\nany monkey. His prejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct.\r\nAnd so these inhuman sons of men&mdash;&mdash;! I tried to look at the\r\nthing in a scientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more\r\nremote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago. And\r\nthe intelligence that would have made this state of things a torment had\r\ngone. Why should I trouble myself? These Eloi were mere fatted cattle,\r\nwhich the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed upon&mdash;probably saw to\r\nthe breeding of. And there was Weena dancing at my side!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming\r\nupon me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man\r\nhad been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his\r\nfellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse, and in the\r\nfullness of time Necessity had come home to him. I even tried a\r\nCarlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay. But this attitude\r\nof mind was impossible. However great their intellectual degradation, the\r\nEloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim my sympathy, and to\r\nmake me perforce a sharer in their degradation and their Fear.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should\r\npursue. My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to make\r\nmyself such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That necessity was\r\nimmediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some means of fire, so\r\nthat I should have the weapon of a torch at hand, for nothing, I knew,\r\nwould be more efficient against these Morlocks. Then I wanted to arrange\r\nsome contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the White Sphinx.\r\nI had in mind a battering ram. I had a persuasion that if I could enter\r\nthose doors and carry a blaze of light before me I should discover the Time\r\nMachine and escape. I could not imagine the Morlocks were strong enough to\r\nmove it far away. Weena I had resolved to bring with me to our own time.\r\nAnd turning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards the\r\nbuilding which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"chap11\"></a></p> <h3> XI </h3>\r\n\r\n","text":"X\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Night Came\r\n\r\n“Now, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto, except\r\nduring my night’s anguish at the loss of the Time Machine, I had felt a\r\nsustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was staggered by\r\nthese new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought myself impeded by\r\nthe childish simplicity of the little people, and by some unknown\r\nforces which I had only to understand to overcome; but there was an\r\naltogether new element in the sickening quality of the Morlocks—a\r\nsomething inhuman and malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, I\r\nhad felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was\r\nwith the pit and how to get out of it. Now I felt like a beast in a\r\ntrap, whose enemy would come upon him soon.\r\n\r\n“The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the new\r\nmoon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible\r\nremarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now such a very difficult\r\nproblem to guess what the coming Dark Nights might mean. The moon was\r\non the wane: each night there was a longer interval of darkness. And I\r\nnow understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear of\r\nthe little Upperworld people for the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul\r\nvillainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt\r\npretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upperworld\r\npeople might once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks\r\ntheir mechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two\r\nspecies that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down\r\ntowards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new relationship. The\r\nEloi, like the Carlovignan kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful\r\nfutility. They still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the\r\nMorlocks, subterranean for innumerable generations, had come at last to\r\nfind the daylit surface intolerable. And the Morlocks made their\r\ngarments, I inferred, and maintained them in their habitual needs,\r\nperhaps through the survival of an old habit of service. They did it as\r\na standing horse paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals\r\nin sport: because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on\r\nthe organism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed.\r\nThe Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago,\r\nthousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of the\r\nease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back—changed!\r\nAlready the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew. They were\r\nbecoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came into my head\r\nthe memory of the meat I had seen in the Underworld. It seemed odd how\r\nit floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were by the current of my\r\nmeditations, but coming in almost like a question from outside. I tried\r\nto recall the form of it. I had a vague sense of something familiar,\r\nbut I could not tell what it was at the time.\r\n\r\n“Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their\r\nmysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this age\r\nof ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not paralyse\r\nand mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend myself.\r\nWithout further delay I determined to make myself arms and a fastness\r\nwhere I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could face this\r\nstrange world with some of that confidence I had lost in realising to\r\nwhat creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt I could never sleep\r\nagain until my bed was secure from them. I shuddered with horror to\r\nthink how they must already have examined me.\r\n\r\n“I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but\r\nfound nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All the\r\nbuildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous\r\nclimbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the\r\ntall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished gleam\r\nof its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening, taking Weena\r\nlike a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills towards the\r\nsouth-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or eight miles, but\r\nit must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen the place on a\r\nmoist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished. In addition,\r\nthe heel of one of my shoes was loose, and a nail was working through\r\nthe sole—they were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoors—so that I\r\nwas lame. And it was already long past sunset when I came in sight of\r\nthe palace, silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky.\r\n\r\n“Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but after a\r\nwhile she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the side of me,\r\noccasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my\r\npockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at the last she had\r\nconcluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases for floral\r\ndecoration. At least she utilised them for that purpose. And that\r\nreminds me! In changing my jacket I found…”\r\n\r\n_The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently\r\nplaced two withered flowers, not unlike very large white mallows, upon\r\nthe little table. Then he resumed his narrative._\r\n\r\n“As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the\r\nhill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to return to\r\nthe house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the\r\nPalace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand\r\nthat we were seeking a refuge there from her Fear.

Only ragged vestiges of glass\r\nremained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had fallen\r\naway from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high upon a turfy\r\ndown, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was surprised to\r\nsee a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged Wandsworth and Battersea\r\nmust once have been. I thought then&mdash;though I never followed up the\r\nthought&mdash;of what might have happened, or might be happening, to the\r\nliving things in the sea.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed\r\nporcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some unknown\r\ncharacter. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might help me to\r\ninterpret this, but I only learnt that the bare idea of writing had never\r\nentered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, more human than she\r\nwas, perhaps because her affection was so human.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Within the big valves of the door&mdash;which were open and\r\nbroken&mdash;we found, instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by\r\nmany side windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum. The\r\ntiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous\r\nobjects was shrouded in the same grey covering. Then I perceived, standing\r\nstrange and gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearly the lower\r\npart of a huge skeleton. I recognised by the oblique feet that it was some\r\nextinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the\r\nupper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where\r\nrain-water had dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing itself had\r\nbeen worn away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a\r\nBrontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the side I\r\nfound what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away the thick\r\ndust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own time. But they must\r\nhave been air-tight to judge from the fair preservation of some of their\r\ncontents.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South\r\nKensington! Here, apparently, was the Palæontological Section, and a very\r\nsplendid array of fossils it must have been, though the inevitable process\r\nof decay that had been staved off for a time, and had, through the\r\nextinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine hundredths of its force,\r\nwas nevertheless, with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness at work\r\nagain upon all its treasures. Here and there I found traces of the little\r\npeople in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings\r\nupon reeds. And the cases had in some instances been bodily\r\nremoved&mdash;by the Morlocks, as I judged. The place was very silent. The\r\nthick dust deadened our footsteps. Weena, who had been rolling a sea urchin\r\ndown the sloping glass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and\r\nvery quietly took my hand and stood beside me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of\r\nan intellectual age that I gave no thought to the possibilities it\r\npresented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a little\r\nfrom my mind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green\r\nPorcelain had a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palæontology;\r\npossibly historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me, at least\r\nin my present circumstances, these would be vastly more interesting than\r\nthis spectacle of old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another\r\nshort gallery running transversely to the first. This appeared to be\r\ndevoted to minerals, and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind\r\nrunning on gunpowder. But I could find no saltpetre; indeed, no nitrates of\r\nany kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in\r\nmy mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the rest of the contents of\r\nthat gallery, though on the whole they were the best preserved of all I\r\nsaw, I had little interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on\r\ndown a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had entered.\r\nApparently this section had been devoted to natural history, but everything\r\nhad long since passed out of recognition. A few shrivelled and blackened\r\nvestiges of what had once been stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in jars\r\nthat had once held spirit, a brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I\r\nwas sorry for that, because I should have been glad to trace the patient\r\nreadjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been attained.\r\nThen we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly\r\nill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the end at\r\nwhich I entered. At intervals white globes hung from the ceiling&mdash;many\r\nof them cracked and smashed&mdash;which suggested that originally the place\r\nhad been artificially lit. Here I was more in my element, for rising on\r\neither side of me were the huge bulks of big machines, all greatly corroded\r\nand many broken down, but some still fairly complete. You know I have a\r\ncertain weakness for mechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these;\r\nthe more so as for the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I\r\ncould make only the vaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that\r\nif I could solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession of powers\r\nthat might be of use against the Morlocks.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she\r\nstartled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have noticed\r\nthat the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It may be, of\r\ncourse, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum was built into\r\nthe side of a hill.&mdash;ED.] The end I had come in at was quite above\r\nground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you went down the length,\r\nthe ground came up against these windows, until at last there was a pit\r\nlike the &lsquo;area&lsquo; of a London house before each, and only a\r\nnarrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling about the\r\nmachines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the gradual\r\ndiminution of the light, until Weena&rsquo;s increasing apprehensions drew\r\nmy attention. Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into a thick\r\ndarkness. I hesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust\r\nwas less abundant and its surface less even. Further away towards the\r\ndimness, it appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints.\r\nMy sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that. I felt\r\nthat I was wasting my time in the academic examination of machinery. I\r\ncalled to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon, and that\r\nI had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means of making a fire. And then\r\ndown in the remote blackness of the gallery I heard a peculiar pattering,\r\nand the same odd noises I had heard down the well.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I took Weena&rsquo;s hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I\r\nleft her and turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike\r\nthose in a signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this lever\r\nin my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly Weena, deserted\r\nin the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged the strength of the\r\nlever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minute&rsquo;s strain, and I\r\nrejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged, for any\r\nMorlock skull I might encounter. And I longed very much to kill a Morlock\r\nor so. Very inhuman, you may think, to want to go killing one&rsquo;s own\r\ndescendants! But it was impossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the\r\nthings. Only my disinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if I\r\nbegan to slake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer,\r\nrestrained me from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes I\r\nheard.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that\r\ngallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first glance\r\nreminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags. The brown and\r\ncharred rags that hung from the sides of it, I presently recognised as the\r\ndecaying vestiges of books. They had long since dropped to pieces, and\r\nevery semblance of print had left them. But here and there were warped\r\nboards and cracked metallic clasps that told the tale well enough. Had I\r\nbeen a literary man I might, perhaps, have moralised upon the futility of\r\nall ambition. But as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force\r\nwas the enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting\r\npaper testified. At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly of the\r\n<i>Philosophical Transactions</i> and my own seventeen papers upon physical\r\noptics.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been\r\na gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little hope of\r\nuseful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had collapsed, this\r\ngallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every unbroken case. And at\r\nlast, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box of matches. Very\r\neagerly I tried them. They were perfectly good. They were not even damp. I\r\nturned to Weena. &lsquo;Dance,&rsquo; I cried to her in her own tongue. For\r\nnow I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared. And so,\r\nin that derelict museum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to\r\nWeena&rsquo;s huge delight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance,\r\nwhistling <i>The Land of the Leal</i> as cheerfully as I could. In part it\r\nwas a modest <i>cancan</i>, in part a step dance, in part a skirt dance (so\r\nfar as my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally\r\ninventive, as you know.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped\r\nthe wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for me it was\r\na most fortunate, thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier\r\nsubstance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that by\r\nchance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at first\r\nthat it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But the odour\r\nof camphor was unmistakable. In the universal decay this volatile substance\r\nhad chanced to survive, perhaps through many thousands of centuries. It\r\nreminded me of a sepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a\r\nfossil Belemnite that must have perished and become fossilised millions of\r\nyears ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that it was\r\ninflammable and burnt with a good bright flame&mdash;was, in fact, an\r\nexcellent candle&mdash;and I put it in my pocket. I found no explosives,\r\nhowever, nor any means of breaking down the bronze doors. As yet my iron\r\ncrowbar was the most helpful thing I had chanced upon. Nevertheless I left\r\nthat gallery greatly elated.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would\r\nrequire a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all the\r\nproper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms, and how\r\nI hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword. I could not carry\r\nboth, however, and my bar of iron promised best against the bronze gates.\r\nThere were numbers of guns, pistols, and rifles. The most were masses of\r\nrust, but many were of some new metal, and still fairly sound. But any\r\ncartridges or powder there may once have been had rotted into dust. One\r\ncorner I saw was charred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion\r\namong the specimens. In another place was a vast array of\r\nidols&mdash;Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phœnician, every country on\r\nearth, I should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I\r\nwrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from South America that\r\nparticularly took my fancy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery\r\nafter gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes mere\r\nheaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I suddenly found\r\nmyself near the model of a tin mine, and then by the merest accident I\r\ndiscovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite cartridges! I shouted\r\n&lsquo;Eureka!&rsquo; and smashed the case with joy. Then came a doubt. I\r\nhesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery, I made my essay. I never\r\nfelt such a disappointment as I did in waiting five, ten, fifteen minutes\r\nfor an explosion that never came. Of course the things were dummies, as I\r\nmight have guessed from their presence. I really believe that had they not\r\nbeen so, I should have rushed off incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze\r\ndoors, and (as it proved) my chances of finding the Time Machine, all\r\ntogether into non-existence.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court\r\nwithin the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we rested\r\nand refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider our position.\r\nNight was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible hiding-place had still to\r\nbe found. But that troubled me very little now. I had in my possession a\r\nthing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against the\r\nMorlocks&mdash;I had matches! I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a\r\nblaze were needed. It seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be\r\nto pass the night in the open, protected by a fire. In the morning there\r\nwas the getting of the Time Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my\r\niron mace. But now, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently\r\ntowards those bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them,\r\nlargely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never impressed\r\nme as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether\r\ninadequate for the work.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"chap12\"></a></p> <h3> XII </h3>\r\n\r\n","text":"XI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Palace of Green Porcelain\r\n\r\n“I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about\r\nnoon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass\r\nremained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had\r\nfallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high upon\r\na turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was\r\nsurprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged\r\nWandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then—though I\r\nnever followed up the thought—of what might have happened, or might be\r\nhappening, to the living things in the sea.\r\n\r\n“The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed\r\nporcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some\r\nunknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might help\r\nme to interpret this, but I only learnt that the bare idea of writing\r\nhad never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, more\r\nhuman than she was, perhaps because her affection was so human.\r\n\r\n“Within the big valves of the door—which were open and broken—we found,\r\ninstead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many side windows.\r\nAt the first glance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor was\r\nthick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was\r\nshrouded in the same grey covering. Then I perceived, standing strange\r\nand gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearly the lower part of\r\na huge skeleton. I recognised by the oblique feet that it was some\r\nextinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and\r\nthe upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place,\r\nwhere rain-water had dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing\r\nitself had been worn away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton\r\nbarrel of a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going\r\ntowards the side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and\r\nclearing away the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of\r\nour own time. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair\r\npreservation of some of their contents.\r\n\r\n“Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South Kensington!\r\nHere, apparently, was the Palæontological Section, and a very splendid\r\narray of fossils it must have been, though the inevitable process of\r\ndecay that had been staved off for a time, and had, through the\r\nextinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine hundredths of its\r\nforce, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness\r\nat work again upon all its treasures. Here and there I found traces of\r\nthe little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or\r\nthreaded in strings upon reeds. And the cases had in some instances\r\nbeen bodily removed—by the Morlocks, as I judged. The place was very\r\nsilent. The thick dust deadened our footsteps. Weena, who had been\r\nrolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case, presently came,\r\nas I stared about me, and very quietly took my hand and stood beside\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an\r\nintellectual age that I gave no thought to the possibilities it\r\npresented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a\r\nlittle from my mind.\r\n\r\n“To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain\r\nhad a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palæontology; possibly\r\nhistorical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me, at least in\r\nmy present circumstances, these would be vastly more interesting than\r\nthis spectacle of old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another\r\nshort gallery running transversely to the first. This appeared to be\r\ndevoted to minerals, and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind\r\nrunning on gunpowder. But I could find no saltpetre; indeed, no\r\nnitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago. Yet the\r\nsulphur hung in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the\r\nrest of the contents of that gallery, though on the whole they were the\r\nbest preserved of all I saw, I had little interest. I am no specialist\r\nin mineralogy, and I went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel\r\nto the first hall I had entered. Apparently this section had been\r\ndevoted to natural history, but everything had long since passed out of\r\nrecognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once\r\nbeen stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held\r\nspirit, a brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for\r\nthat, because I should have been glad to trace the patient\r\nreadjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been\r\nattained. Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but\r\nsingularly ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle\r\nfrom the end at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from\r\nthe ceiling—many of them cracked and smashed—which suggested that\r\noriginally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in my\r\nelement, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big\r\nmachines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some still\r\nfairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for mechanism, and\r\nI was inclined to linger among these; the more so as for the most part\r\nthey had the interest of puzzles, and I could make only the vaguest\r\nguesses at what they were for. I fancied that if I could solve their\r\npuzzles I should find myself in possession of powers that might be of\r\nuse against the Morlocks.\r\n\r\n“Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she\r\nstartled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have\r\nnoticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It may\r\nbe, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum was\r\nbuilt into the side of a hill.—ED.] The end I had come in at was quite\r\nabove ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you went down\r\nthe length, the ground came up against these windows, until at last\r\nthere was a pit like the ‘area‘ of a London house before each, and only\r\na narrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling\r\nabout the machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the\r\ngradual diminution of the light, until Weena’s increasing apprehensions\r\ndrew my attention. Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into a\r\nthick darkness. I hesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that\r\nthe dust was less abundant and its surface less even. Further away\r\ntowards the dimness, it appeared to be broken by a number of small\r\nnarrow footprints. My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks\r\nrevived at that. I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic\r\nexamination of machinery. I called to mind that it was already far\r\nadvanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge,\r\nand no means of making a fire.

I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next morning,\r\nand ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods that had stopped me\r\non the previous journey. My plan was to go as far as possible that night,\r\nand then, building a fire, to sleep in the protection of its glare.\r\nAccordingly, as we went along I gathered any sticks or dried grass I saw,\r\nand presently had my arms full of such litter. Thus loaded, our progress\r\nwas slower than I had anticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I,\r\nalso, began to suffer from sleepiness too; so that it was full night before\r\nwe reached the wood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have\r\nstopped, fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending\r\ncalamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me onward.\r\nI had been without sleep for a night and two days, and I was feverish and\r\nirritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim\r\nagainst their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was scrub and\r\nlong grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from their insidious\r\napproach. The forest, I calculated, was rather less than a mile across. If\r\nwe could get through it to the bare hillside, there, as it seemed to me,\r\nwas an altogether safer resting-place; I thought that with my matches and\r\nmy camphor I could contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods.\r\nYet it was evident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should\r\nhave to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down. And\r\nthen it came into my head that I would amaze our friends behind by lighting\r\nit. I was to discover the atrocious folly of this proceeding, but it came\r\nto my mind as an ingenious move for covering our retreat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing\r\nflame must be in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The\r\nsun&rsquo;s heat is rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused\r\nby dewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts. Lightning\r\nmay blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire.\r\nDecaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its\r\nfermentation, but this rarely results in flame. In this decadence, too, the\r\nart of fire-making had been forgotten on the earth. The red tongues that\r\nwent licking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to\r\nWeena.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would\r\nhave cast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up,\r\nand in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the wood. For\r\na little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking back presently, I\r\ncould see, through the crowded stems, that from my heap of sticks the blaze\r\nhad spread to some bushes adjacent, and a curved line of fire was creeping\r\nup the grass of the hill. I laughed at that, and turned again to the dark\r\ntrees before me. It was very black, and Weena clung to me convulsively, but\r\nthere was still, as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient\r\nlight for me to avoid the stems. Overhead it was simply black, except where\r\na gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there. I lit none\r\nof my matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left arm I carried my\r\nlittle one, in my right hand I had my iron bar.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my\r\nfeet, the faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the\r\nthrob of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a pattering\r\nbehind me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more distinct, and then I\r\ncaught the same queer sound and voices I had heard in the Underworld.\r\nThere were evidently several of the Morlocks, and they were closing in upon\r\nme. Indeed, in another minute I felt a tug at my coat, then something at my\r\narm. And Weena shivered violently, and became quite still.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I\r\ndid so, and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness\r\nabout my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar\r\ncooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands, too, were creeping over\r\nmy coat and back, touching even my neck. Then the match scratched and\r\nfizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the white backs of the Morlocks in\r\nflight amid the trees. I hastily took a lump of camphor from my pocket, and\r\nprepared to light it as soon as the match should wane. Then I looked at\r\nWeena. She was lying clutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face\r\nto the ground. With a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely\r\nto breathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground, and as\r\nit split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the shadows, I knelt\r\ndown and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full of the stir and murmur of\r\na great company!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder\r\nand rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realisation. In\r\nmanœuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about several\r\ntimes, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my path.\r\nFor all I knew, I might be facing back towards the Palace of Green\r\nPorcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to think rapidly what to\r\ndo. I determined to build a fire and encamp where we were. I put Weena,\r\nstill motionless, down upon a turfy bole, and very hastily, as my first\r\nlump of camphor waned, I began collecting sticks and leaves. Here and there\r\nout of the darkness round me the Morlocks&rsquo; eyes shone like\r\ncarbuncles.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did\r\nso, two white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away.\r\nOne was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I felt\r\nhis bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of dismay,\r\nstaggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece of camphor, and\r\nwent on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed how dry was some of the\r\nfoliage above me, for since my arrival on the Time Machine, a matter of a\r\nweek, no rain had fallen. So, instead of casting about among the trees for\r\nfallen twigs, I began leaping up and dragging down branches. Very soon I\r\nhad a choking smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and could economise\r\nmy camphor. Then I turned to where Weena lay beside my iron mace. I tried\r\nwhat I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I could not even\r\nsatisfy myself whether or not she breathed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have\r\nmade me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in the air.\r\nMy fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I felt very weary\r\nafter my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was full of a slumbrous\r\nmurmur that I did not understand. I seemed just to nod and open my eyes.\r\nBut all was dark, and the Morlocks had their hands upon me. Flinging off\r\ntheir clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket for the match-box,\r\nand&mdash;it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me again. In a\r\nmoment I knew what had happened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and\r\nthe bitterness of death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the\r\nsmell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms,\r\nand pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to feel all\r\nthese soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in a monstrous\r\nspider&rsquo;s web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt little teeth\r\nnipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my hand came against my\r\niron lever. It gave me strength. I struggled up, shaking the human rats\r\nfrom me, and, holding the bar short, I thrust where I judged their faces\r\nmight be. I could feel the succulent giving of flesh and bone under my\r\nblows, and for a moment I was free.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard\r\nfighting came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I\r\ndetermined to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my back to\r\na tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was full of the\r\nstir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices seemed to rise to a\r\nhigher pitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yet none came\r\nwithin reach. I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came hope.\r\nWhat if the Morlocks were afraid? And close on the heels of that came a\r\nstrange thing. The darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to\r\nsee the Morlocks about me&mdash;three battered at my feet&mdash;and then I\r\nrecognised, with incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in an\r\nincessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the wood\r\nin front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish. As I stood\r\nagape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight\r\nbetween the branches, and vanish. And at that I understood the smell of\r\nburning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar,\r\nthe red glow, and the Morlocks&rsquo; flight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through\r\nthe black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest. It\r\nwas my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for Weena, but she\r\nwas gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the explosive thud as each\r\nfresh tree burst into flame, left little time for reflection. My iron bar\r\nstill gripped, I followed in the Morlocks&rsquo; path. It was a close race.\r\nOnce the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was\r\noutflanked and had to strike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a\r\nsmall open space, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me,\r\nand past me, and went on straight into the fire!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think,\r\nof all that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright as\r\nday with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock or\r\ntumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was another arm of\r\nthe burning forest, with yellow tongues already writhing from it,\r\ncompletely encircling the space with a fence of fire. Upon the hillside\r\nwere some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled by the light and heat, and\r\nblundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment. At\r\nfirst I did not realise their blindness, and struck furiously at them with\r\nmy bar, in a frenzy of fear, as they approached me, killing one and\r\ncrippling several more. But when I had watched the gestures of one of them\r\ngroping under the hawthorn against the red sky, and heard their moans, I\r\nwas assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I\r\nstruck no more of them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me,\r\nsetting loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one\r\ntime the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would\r\npresently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the fight by\r\nkilling some of them before this should happen; but the fire burst out\r\nagain brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about the hill among them\r\nand avoided them, looking for some trace of Weena. But Weena was gone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this\r\nstrange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and making\r\nuncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat on them. The\r\ncoiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and through the rare\r\ntatters of that red canopy, remote as though they belonged to another\r\nuniverse, shone the little stars. Two or three Morlocks came blundering\r\ninto me, and I drove them off with blows of my fists, trembling as I did\r\nso.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a\r\nnightmare. I bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I\r\nbeat the ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and wandered\r\nhere and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to rubbing my eyes\r\nand calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw Morlocks put their heads\r\ndown in a kind of agony and rush into the flames. But, at last, above the\r\nsubsiding red of the fire, above the streaming masses of black smoke and\r\nthe whitening and blackening tree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of\r\nthese dim creatures, came the white light of the day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was\r\nplain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I cannot\r\ndescribe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate to\r\nwhich it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was almost moved to begin\r\na massacre of the helpless abominations about me, but I contained myself.\r\nThe hillock, as I have said, was a kind of island in the forest. From its\r\nsummit I could now make out through a haze of smoke the Palace of Green\r\nPorcelain, and from that I could get my bearings for the White Sphinx. And\r\nso, leaving the remnant of these damned souls still going hither and\r\nthither and moaning, as the day grew clearer, I tied some grass about my\r\nfeet and limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems that still\r\npulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of the Time\r\nMachine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well as lame, and\r\nI felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death of little Weena.\r\nIt seemed an overwhelming calamity. Now, in this old familiar room, it is\r\nmore like the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss. But that morning it\r\nleft me absolutely lonely again&mdash;terribly alone. I began to think of\r\nthis house of mine, of this fireside, of some of you, and with such\r\nthoughts came a longing that was pain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;But, as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning\r\nsky, I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose\r\nmatches. The box must have leaked before it was lost.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"chap13\"></a></p> <h3> XIII </h3>\r\n\r\n","text":"XII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Darkness\r\n\r\n“We emerged from the Palace while the sun was still in part above the\r\nhorizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next\r\nmorning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods that had\r\nstopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as far as\r\npossible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep in the\r\nprotection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I gathered any\r\nsticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms full of such\r\nlitter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had anticipated,\r\nand besides Weena was tired. And I, also, began to suffer from\r\nsleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the wood.\r\nUpon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped, fearing the\r\ndarkness before us; but a singular sense of impending calamity, that\r\nshould indeed have served me as a warning, drove me onward. I had been\r\nwithout sleep for a night and two days, and I was feverish and\r\nirritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it.\r\n\r\n“While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against\r\ntheir blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was scrub and\r\nlong grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from their insidious\r\napproach. The forest, I calculated, was rather less than a mile across.\r\nIf we could get through it to the bare hillside, there, as it seemed to\r\nme, was an altogether safer resting-place; I thought that with my\r\nmatches and my camphor I could contrive to keep my path illuminated\r\nthrough the woods. Yet it was evident that if I was to flourish matches\r\nwith my hands I should have to abandon my firewood; so, rather\r\nreluctantly, I put it down. And then it came into my head that I would\r\namaze our friends behind by lighting it. I was to discover the\r\natrocious folly of this proceeding, but it came to my mind as an\r\ningenious move for covering our retreat.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be\r\nin the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun’s heat is\r\nrarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by dewdrops, as\r\nis sometimes the case in more tropical districts. Lightning may blast\r\nand blacken, but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire. Decaying\r\nvegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation,\r\nbut this rarely results in flame. In this decadence, too, the art of\r\nfire-making had been forgotten on the earth. The red tongues that went\r\nlicking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to\r\nWeena.\r\n\r\n“She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have\r\ncast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up, and\r\nin spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the wood. For\r\na little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking back presently,\r\nI could see, through the crowded stems, that from my heap of sticks the\r\nblaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a curved line of fire was\r\ncreeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed at that, and turned again\r\nto the dark trees before me. It was very black, and Weena clung to me\r\nconvulsively, but there was still, as my eyes grew accustomed to the\r\ndarkness, sufficient light for me to avoid the stems. Overhead it was\r\nsimply black, except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us\r\nhere and there. I lit none of my matches because I had no hand free.\r\nUpon my left arm I carried my little one, in my right hand I had my\r\niron bar.\r\n\r\n“For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet,\r\nthe faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the\r\nthrob of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a\r\npattering behind me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more\r\ndistinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had heard\r\nin the Underworld. There were evidently several of the Morlocks, and\r\nthey were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another minute I felt a tug at\r\nmy coat, then something at my arm. And Weena shivered violently, and\r\nbecame quite still.\r\n\r\n“It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did so,\r\nand, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness\r\nabout my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar\r\ncooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands, too, were creeping\r\nover my coat and back, touching even my neck. Then the match scratched\r\nand fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the white backs of the Morlocks\r\nin flight amid the trees. I hastily took a lump of camphor from my\r\npocket, and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane. Then\r\nI looked at Weena. She was lying clutching my feet and quite\r\nmotionless, with her face to the ground. With a sudden fright I stooped\r\nto her. She seemed scarcely to breathe. I lit the block of camphor and\r\nflung it to the ground, and as it split and flared up and drove back\r\nthe Morlocks and the shadows, I knelt down and lifted her.

I lit a match, and as I did so,\r\ntwo white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away.\r\nOne was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I\r\nfelt his bones grind under the blow of my fist.

I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and could not\r\nrefrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Here was the same\r\nbeautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same splendid palaces and\r\nmagnificent ruins, the same silver river running between its fertile banks.\r\nThe gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and thither among the\r\ntrees. Some were bathing in exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and\r\nthat suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain. And like blots upon the\r\nlandscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the Underworld. I understood\r\nnow what all the beauty of the Overworld people covered.

And this time I was not seated properly in the\r\nsaddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite time I\r\nclung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite unheeding how I went,\r\nand when I brought myself to look at the dials again I was amazed to find\r\nwhere I had arrived. One dial records days, and another thousands of days,\r\nanother millions of days, and another thousands of millions. Now, instead\r\nof reversing the levers, I had pulled them over so as to go forward with\r\nthem, and when I came to look at these indicators I found that the\r\nthousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a\r\nwatch&mdash;into futurity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of\r\nthings. The palpitating greyness grew darker; then&mdash;though I was still\r\ntravelling with prodigious velocity&mdash;the blinking succession of day\r\nand night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace, returned, and\r\ngrew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much at first. The\r\nalternations of night and day grew slower and slower, and so did the\r\npassage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed to stretch through\r\ncenturies. At last a steady twilight brooded over the earth, a twilight\r\nonly broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky. The\r\nband of light that had indicated the sun had long since disappeared; for\r\nthe sun had ceased to set&mdash;it simply rose and fell in the west, and\r\ngrew ever broader and more red. All trace of the moon had vanished. The\r\ncircling of the stars, growing slower and slower, had given place to\r\ncreeping points of light. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red\r\nand very large, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing\r\nwith a dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction. At one\r\ntime it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again, but it\r\nspeedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by this slowing down\r\nof its rising and setting that the work of the tidal drag was done. The\r\nearth had come to rest with one face to the sun, even as in our own time\r\nthe moon faces the earth. Very cautiously, for I remembered my former\r\nheadlong fall, I began to reverse my motion. Slower and slower went the\r\ncircling hands until the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one\r\nwas no longer a mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim\r\noutlines of a desolate beach grew visible.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking\r\nround. The sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black, and\r\nout of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars.\r\nOverhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it grew\r\nbrighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, lay the huge hull\r\nof the sun, red and motionless. The rocks about me were of a harsh reddish\r\ncolour, and all the trace of life that I could see at first was the\r\nintensely green vegetation that covered every projecting point on their\r\nsouth-eastern face. It was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss\r\nor on the lichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual\r\ntwilight.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched\r\naway to the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan\r\nsky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was\r\nstirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing,\r\nand showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living. And along the\r\nmargin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of\r\nsalt&mdash;pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of oppression in my\r\nhead, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast. The sensation reminded\r\nme of my only experience of mountaineering, and from that I judged the air\r\nto be more rarefied than it is now.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a\r\nthing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the\r\nsky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The sound of\r\nits voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly upon\r\nthe machine. Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, what I had\r\ntaken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me. Then I saw\r\nthe thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you imagine a crab\r\nas large as yonder table, with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly,\r\nits big claws swaying, its long antennæ, like carters&rsquo; whips, waving\r\nand feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its\r\nmetallic front? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly\r\nbosses, and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could see\r\nthe many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it\r\nmoved.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I\r\nfelt a tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to\r\nbrush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost\r\nimmediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught something\r\nthreadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a frightful qualm, I\r\nturned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna of another monster crab\r\nthat stood just behind me. Its evil eyes were wriggling on their stalks,\r\nits mouth was all alive with appetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared\r\nwith an algal slime, were descending upon me. In a moment my hand was on\r\nthe lever, and I had placed a month between myself and these monsters. But\r\nI was still on the same beach, and I saw them distinctly now as soon as I\r\nstopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there, in the sombre\r\nlight, among the foliated sheets of intense green.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over\r\nthe world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea,\r\nthe stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the\r\nuniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous plants, the thin air that\r\nhurts one&rsquo;s lungs: all contributed to an appalling effect. I moved on\r\na hundred years, and there was the same red sun&mdash;a little larger, a\r\nlittle duller&mdash;the same dying sea, the same chill air, and the same\r\ncrowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and the\r\nred rocks. And in the westward sky, I saw a curved pale line like a vast\r\nnew moon.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a\r\nthousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth&rsquo;s fate,\r\nwatching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in the\r\nwestward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At last, more than\r\nthirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of the sun had come to\r\nobscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens. Then I stopped once\r\nmore, for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared, and the red\r\nbeach, save for its livid green liverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless.\r\nAnd now it was flecked with white. A bitter cold assailed me. Rare white\r\nflakes ever and again came eddying down. To the north-eastward, the glare\r\nof snow lay under the starlight of the sable sky, and I could see an\r\nundulating crest of hillocks pinkish white. There were fringes of ice along\r\nthe sea margin, with drifting masses farther out; but the main expanse of\r\nthat salt ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still\r\nunfrozen.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A\r\ncertain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the\r\nmachine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green slime\r\non the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A shallow sandbank\r\nhad appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the beach. I fancied\r\nI saw some black object flopping about upon this bank, but it became\r\nmotionless as I looked at it, and I judged that my eye had been deceived,\r\nand that the black object was merely a rock. The stars in the sky were\r\nintensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very little.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun\r\nhad changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I saw this\r\ngrow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this blackness that\r\nwas creeping over the day, and then I realised that an eclipse was\r\nbeginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was passing across the\r\nsun&rsquo;s disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be the moon, but there\r\nis much to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of\r\nan inner planet passing very near to the earth.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening\r\ngusts from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in\r\nnumber. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond these\r\nlifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent? It would be hard to convey\r\nthe stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleating of sheep, the\r\ncries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the background of\r\nour lives&mdash;all that was over. As the darkness thickened, the eddying\r\nflakes grew more abundant, dancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air\r\nmore intense. At last, one by one, swiftly, one after the other, the white\r\npeaks of the distant hills vanished into blackness. The breeze rose to a\r\nmoaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping\r\ntowards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were visible. All else\r\nwas rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote\r\nto my marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I shivered,\r\nand a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared\r\nthe edge of the sun. I got off the machine to recover myself. I felt giddy\r\nand incapable of facing the return journey. As I stood sick and confused I\r\nsaw again the moving thing upon the shoal&mdash;there was no mistake now\r\nthat it was a moving thing&mdash;against the red water of the sea. It was a\r\nround thing, the size of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and\r\ntentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering\r\nblood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt I was\r\nfainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote and awful\r\ntwilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"chap15\"></a></p> <h3> XV </h3>\r\n\r\n","text":"XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Further Vision\r\n\r\n“I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with\r\ntime travelling.

Its back was corrugated and\r\nornamented with ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustation blotched\r\nit here and there. I could see the many palps of its complicated mouth\r\nflickering and feeling as it moved.\r\n\r\n“As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt a\r\ntickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to\r\nbrush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost\r\nimmediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught\r\nsomething threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a\r\nfrightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna of\r\nanother monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes were\r\nwriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with appetite, and\r\nits vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime, were descending\r\nupon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and I had placed a month\r\nbetween myself and these monsters. But I was still on the same beach,\r\nand I saw them distinctly now as soon as I stopped. Dozens of them\r\nseemed to be crawling here and there, in the sombre light, among the\r\nfoliated sheets of intense green.\r\n\r\n“I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the\r\nworld. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea,\r\nthe stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the\r\nuniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous plants, the thin air\r\nthat hurts one’s lungs: all contributed to an appalling effect. I moved\r\non a hundred years, and there was the same red sun—a little larger, a\r\nlittle duller—the same dying sea, the same chill air, and the same\r\ncrowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and\r\nthe red rocks. And in the westward sky, I saw a curved pale line like a\r\nvast new moon.\r\n\r\n“So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a\r\nthousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth’s fate,\r\nwatching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in\r\nthe westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At last, more\r\nthan thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of the sun had\r\ncome to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens. Then I\r\nstopped once more, for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared,\r\nand the red beach, save for its livid green liverworts and lichens,\r\nseemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with white. A bitter cold\r\nassailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down. To the\r\nnorth-eastward, the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable\r\nsky, and I could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white.\r\nThere were fringes of ice along the sea margin, with drifting masses\r\nfarther out; but the main expanse of that salt ocean, all bloody under\r\nthe eternal sunset, was still unfrozen.\r\n\r\n“I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A\r\ncertain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the\r\nmachine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green\r\nslime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A shallow\r\nsandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the\r\nbeach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about upon this bank,\r\nbut it became motionless as I looked at it, and I judged that my eye\r\nhad been deceived, and that the black object was merely a rock. The\r\nstars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n“Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had\r\nchanged; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I saw this\r\ngrow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this blackness\r\nthat was creeping over the day, and then I realised that an eclipse was\r\nbeginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was passing across the\r\nsun’s disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be the moon, but there is\r\nmuch to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of\r\nan inner planet passing very near to the earth.\r\n\r\n“The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts\r\nfrom the east, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in\r\nnumber. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond\r\nthese lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent? It would be hard to\r\nconvey the stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleating of\r\nsheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the\r\nbackground of our lives—all that was over. As the darkness thickened,\r\nthe eddying flakes grew more abundant, dancing before my eyes; and the\r\ncold of the air more intense. At last, one by one, swiftly, one after\r\nthe other, the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into\r\nblackness. The breeze rose to a moaning wind. I saw the black central\r\nshadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me. In another moment the pale\r\nstars alone were visible. All else was rayless obscurity. The sky was\r\nabsolutely black.\r\n\r\n“A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote to my\r\nmarrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I shivered, and\r\na deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared\r\nthe edge of the sun. I got off the machine to recover myself. I felt\r\ngiddy and incapable of facing the return journey. As I stood sick and\r\nconfused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal—there was no\r\nmistake now that it was a moving thing—against the red water of the\r\nsea. It was a round thing, the size of a football perhaps, or, it may\r\nbe, bigger, and tentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against\r\nthe weltering blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then\r\nI felt I was fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that\r\nremote and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the\r\nsaddle.","updatedAt":"2018-07-19T06:39:08.829Z","createdAt":"2018-07-19T06:39:08.829Z"},{"number":18,"bookId":3,"html":"<h2> The Time Traveller&rsquo;s Return </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;So I came back.

He spoke like one who was\r\ntrying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. &ldquo;They were put into\r\nmy pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.&rdquo; He stared round the\r\nroom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned if it isn&rsquo;t all going. This room and\r\nyou and the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory. Did I ever\r\nmake a Time Machine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all only a\r\ndream? They say life is a dream, a precious poor dream at times&mdash;but I\r\ncan&rsquo;t stand another that won&rsquo;t fit. It&rsquo;s madness.

There in the flickering light of\r\nthe lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and askew, a thing of\r\nbrass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering quartz. Solid to the\r\ntouch&mdash;for I put out my hand and felt the rail of it&mdash;and with\r\nbrown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of grass and moss upon the\r\nlower parts, and one rail bent awry.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand\r\nalong the damaged rail. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right now,&rdquo; he said.\r\n&ldquo;The story I told you was true. I&rsquo;m sorry to have brought you\r\nout here in the cold.&rdquo; He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute\r\nsilence, we returned to the smoking-room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coat.\r\nThe Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation, told\r\nhim he was suffering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely. I remember\r\nhim standing in the open doorway, bawling good-night.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a &ldquo;gaudy\r\nlie.&rdquo; For my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story\r\nwas so fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I lay\r\nawake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go next day and\r\nsee the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the laboratory, and\r\nbeing on easy terms in the house, I went up to him. The laboratory,\r\nhowever, was empty. I stared for a minute at the Time Machine and put out\r\nmy hand and touched the lever. At that the squat substantial-looking mass\r\nswayed like a bough shaken by the wind. Its instability startled me\r\nextremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of the childish days when I used\r\nto be forbidden to meddle. I came back through the corridor. The Time\r\nTraveller met me in the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had\r\na small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed\r\nwhen he saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m frightfully\r\nbusy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with that thing in there.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;But is it not some hoax?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Do you really\r\ntravel through time?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Really and truly I do.&rdquo; And he looked frankly into my eyes.\r\nHe hesitated. His eye wandered about the room. &ldquo;I only want half an\r\nhour,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know why you came, and it&rsquo;s awfully\r\ngood of you. There&rsquo;s some magazines here. If you&rsquo;ll stop to\r\nlunch I&rsquo;ll prove you this time travelling up to the hilt, specimens\r\nand all. If you&rsquo;ll forgive my leaving you now?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words, and\r\nhe nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of the laboratory\r\nslam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily paper. What was he\r\ngoing to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly I was reminded by an\r\nadvertisement that I had promised to meet Richardson, the publisher, at\r\ntwo. I looked at my watch, and saw that I could barely save that\r\nengagement. I got up and went down the passage to tell the Time\r\nTraveller.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly\r\ntruncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled round\r\nme as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken glass\r\nfalling on the floor. The Time Traveller was not there. I seemed to see a\r\nghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black and brass\r\nfor a moment&mdash;a figure so transparent that the bench behind with its\r\nsheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I\r\nrubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of\r\ndust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight\r\nhad, apparently, just been blown in.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had\r\nhappened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing\r\nmight be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened, and the\r\nman-servant appeared.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. &ldquo;Has Mr.\r\n&mdash;&mdash; gone out that way?&rdquo; said I.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find\r\nhim here.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed\r\non, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps still\r\nstranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring with him.\r\nBut I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime. The Time\r\nTraveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows now, he has\r\nnever returned.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<br /><br /><br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"chap17\"></a></p> <h3>  </h3>\r\n\r\n","text":"XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Story\r\n\r\n“I know,” he said, after a pause, “that all this will be absolutely\r\nincredible to you, but to me the one incredible thing is that I am here\r\ntonight in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces and\r\ntelling you these strange adventures.” He looked at the Medical Man.\r\n“No. I cannot expect you to believe it.

Its\r\ninstability startled me extremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of\r\nthe childish days when I used to be forbidden to meddle. I came back\r\nthrough the corridor. The Time Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He\r\nwas coming from the house. He had a small camera under one arm and a\r\nknapsack under the other. He laughed when he saw me, and gave me an\r\nelbow to shake. “I’m frightfully busy,” said he, “with that thing in\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“But is it not some hoax?” I said. “Do you really travel through time?”\r\n\r\n“Really and truly I do.” And he looked frankly into my eyes. He\r\nhesitated. His eye wandered about the room. “I only want half an hour,”\r\nhe said. “I know why you came, and it’s awfully good of you. There’s\r\nsome magazines here. If you’ll stop to lunch I’ll prove you this time\r\ntravelling up to the hilt, specimens and all. If you’ll forgive my\r\nleaving you now?”\r\n\r\nI consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,\r\nand he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of the\r\nlaboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily paper.\r\nWhat was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly I was reminded\r\nby an advertisement that I had promised to meet Richardson, the\r\npublisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw that I could barely\r\nsave that engagement. I got up and went down the passage to tell the\r\nTime Traveller.\r\n\r\nAs I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly\r\ntruncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled\r\nround me as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken\r\nglass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was not there. I seemed\r\nto see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black\r\nand brass for a moment—a figure so transparent that the bench behind\r\nwith its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm\r\nvanished as I rubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a\r\nsubsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A\r\npane of the skylight had, apparently, just been blown in.\r\n\r\nI felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had\r\nhappened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange\r\nthing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,\r\nand the man-servant appeared.\r\n\r\nWe looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. “Has Mr. —— gone out\r\nthat way?” said I.\r\n\r\n“No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nAt that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed\r\non, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps\r\nstill stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring\r\nwith him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime.\r\nThe Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows\r\nnow, he has never returned.","updatedAt":"2018-07-19T06:39:08.829Z","createdAt":"2018-07-19T06:39:08.829Z"},{"number":20,"bookId":3,"html":"<h2> Epilogue </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne cannot choose but wonder.
